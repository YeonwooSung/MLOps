The maze is set up as a 5x5 grid, with one of the 25 cells being the \"goal\" that the player, called the \"seeker,\" must reach. Instead of providing a pre-determined solution, we will use a reinforcement learning algorithm so that the seeker can learn how to find the goal through repeated simulations of the maze. The seeker will be rewarded for reaching the goal and the algorithm will track which decisions were successful and which were not.

    "There are several ways to compare the knowledge of this value to the current state-action value, which is the value stored in the policy's state-action table for the given state and action. One option is to calculate a weighted sum of the old value and the expected value, using a formula such as `new_value = 0.9 * value + 0.1 * next_max`. The weights of `0.9` and `0.1` have been chosen to reflect the preference for keeping the old value, and the important factor is that the weights sum to 1. However, this approach does not take into account the important information from the reward, which should be given more trust than the projected `next_max` value. To account for this, it may be beneficial to discount the `next_max` value by 10%. The updated state-action value would then be calculated as follows:\n",

Now that we have a trained policy, we want to see how well it performs. Previously in this chapter, we ran random policies a couple of times to get an idea of their effectiveness in the maze problem. However, we now want to properly evaluate our trained policy over multiple games and see how it performs on average. Specifically, we will run our simulation for several episodes and measure the number of steps it takes to reach the goal in each episode.

We will store the policy in the object store with ray.put and pass it as an argument to the remote rollout calls to gather experiences over a specified number of training episodes.

It's helpful to compare `train_policy_parallel` and `train_policy` line by line because they have the same overall structure. All we had to do to parallelize the training process was to use the `ray.remote` decorator on a class appropriately and then make the correct remote calls. It's helpful to have some experience to do this correctly, but it's worth noting how little time we spent considering distributed computing and how much time we were able to focus on the actual application code.
