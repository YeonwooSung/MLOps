# Seldon

Seldon is an open source platform for deploying machine learning models on a Kubernetes cluster.
It is designed to help engineers and data scientists deploy their ML models into production safely, securely and at scale.

Seldon uses flask for handling REST requests and gRPC for handling gRPC requests.

## Pre-requisites

Seldon requires a running Kubernetes cluster with kubectl configured to access it.
Also, you should be familiar with the Kubernetes, otherwise it will be hard to understand what is going on.
