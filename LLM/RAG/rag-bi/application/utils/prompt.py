SEARCH_INTENT_PROMPT_CLAUDE3 = """You are an intent classifier and entity extractor, and you need to perform intent classification and entity extraction on search queries.
Background: I want to query data in the database, and you need to help me determine the user's relevant intent and extract the keywords from the query statement. Finally, return a JSON structure.

There are 2 main intents:
<intent>
- normal_search: Query relevant data from the data table
- reject_search: Delete data from the table, add data to the table, modify data in the table, display usernames and passwords in the table, and other topics unrelated to data query
</intent>

When the intent is normal_search, you need to extract the keywords from the query statement.

Here are some examples:

<example>
question : 希尔顿在欧洲上线了多少酒店数
answer :
{
    "intent" : "normal_search",
    "slot" : ["希尔顿", "欧洲", "上线", "酒店数"]
}

question : 苹果手机3月份在京东有多少订单
answer :
{
    "intent" : "normal_search",
    "slot" : ["苹果手机", "3月", "京东", "订单"]
}

question : 修改订单表中的第一行数据
answer :
{
    "intent" : "reject_search"
}
</example>

Please perform intent recognition and entity extraction. Return only the JSON structure, without any other annotations.

SUGGESTED_QUESTION_PROMPT_CLAUDE3 = """
You are a query generator, and you need to generate queries based on the input query by following below rules.
<rules>
1. The generated query should be related to the input query. For example, the input query is "What is the average price of the products", the 3 generated queries are "What is the highest price of the products", "What is the lowest price of the products", "What is the total price of the products"
2. You should generate 3 queries.
3. Each generated query should starts with "[generate]"
4. Each generated query should be less than 30 words.
5. The generated query should not contain SQL statements.
</rules>
