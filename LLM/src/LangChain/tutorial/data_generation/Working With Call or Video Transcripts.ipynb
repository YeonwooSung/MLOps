    "1. **Name/Role -** Put the name of each person before their sentence. Bonus points if you have their role/company included too. Example: Greg (Marin Transitions): Hey! How's it going?\n",
    "2. **System instructions -** Be specific with your system prompt about the role you need you bot to play\n",

Then part two is going to be the actual monitoring part.

Part number one is just gonna be a about an hour long session with one of our implementation partners and your head of social media that's just to make sure that your accounts get set up and that we're doing the tracking properly. Then part two is going to be the actual monitoring part. It takes about four hours to start monitoring, but after that, it'll be available for you in real time and that's just so we can go scrape all the data off the social sites.

      "Human: Greg from Marin Transitions Partner spoke with Eliza, the CMO of ACME Co, about their business and social media presence. ACME Co is a software company that helps nonprofits grow their business with 45 employees and a marketing team of seven. They use Slack, Photoshop, Hubspot, Zoom, and Google Cloud. Eliza estimates that they post about 10 times a month on social media. Marin Transitions Partner helps businesses with social modeling to understand sentiment behind mentions on social media.\n",

      "Greg from Marin Transitions Partner spoke with Eliza from ACME Co about their social monitoring practices. Eliza stated that they have no idea what customers are saying about them on social media, which is a disadvantage in a competitive market. Greg highlighted the value of understanding what customers are saying about their brand in real-time and asked Eliza to put a dollar amount on it. Eliza estimated that having this kind of transparency and visibility into their market could enable them to close one more deal per month, which would be worth $50,000. The decision to purchase would be made by a committee, with the ultimate signer being the CEO Christina. Greg asked about their priorities for a social monitoring tool.\n",

      "Eliza from ACME Co is interested in a social monitoring tool that can accurately and in real-time tell her about the data that her customers are saying about the company and its products to stay ahead of potential risks. She is also looking for a partner that can scale with them as they build out their marketing program and offer hands-on white-glove support. The evaluation process involves Eliza evaluating vendors, narrowing down the list to two options, and presenting her recommendations to the CEO. There is a legal and security review as part of the process, which would be conducted by their in-house counsel. ACME Co is also evaluating Hootsuite as another option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliza from ACME Co is interested in Hootsuite, but is a big supporter of Marin Transitions Partner. She is concerned about support and avoiding shelfware. She asks about the implementation process and how long it takes to get started on the platform. Greg explains that the implementation process is in two parts, with an hour-long session with an implementation partner and the head of social media to set up accounts and ensure proper tracking. The second part is the monitoring process, which takes about four hours to start, but after that, it will be available in real-time. Overall, the implementation process takes about half a day's work.\n",
