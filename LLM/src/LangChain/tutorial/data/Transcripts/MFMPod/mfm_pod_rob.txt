Sam Parr (0:00:00-0:00:06): So does that mean that, like, the vast majority of your real wealth creation has been in, like, the last ten years? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:00:06-0:00:09): No, in the last, like, few years. 

Sam Parr (0:00:10-0:00:12): But you were you you were broke. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:00:12-0:00:21): I was. I would consider myself broke. I would say I started from zero almost in 2016 when I launched the machine. I wouldn't say debt broke. 

Sam Parr (0:00:21-0:00:24): I mean, you're a millionaire. Were you worth at least ten? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:00:25-0:00:29): I would say I was probably worth, like, 15 or 20 in that dump. So not broke. But to me, I was like, bro. 

Shaan Puri (0:00:30-0:00:32): To a future billionaire. A millionaire is broke. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:00:34-0:00:42): I feel like I can rule the world. I know I could be what I want to. I put my all in. It, like, no days off on the road. Let's travel. 

Sam Parr (0:00:42-0:00:47): Sean, say exactly what you just said to me when we finished our recording with Rob Beardick. 

Shaan Puri (0:00:47-0:01:05): I said, I think that was the best episode of MFM we've ever done. I don't know if I'm just on a high right off of it, but I believe so. People can tell in the YouTube comments. They should tell us. To me, this was the best episode we've done 400 something episodes. How many have we done? Jonathan something like 400 episodes. That was the number one. My favorite. 

Sam Parr (0:01:05-0:01:32): The best episode we've ever done from beginning to end. I'm shocked. So you asked him. We started getting along really well, and you said, Rob, what's your net worth? And I was like, Damn, is he going to answer that? And he gave the full answer. We're not going to say it now, but it's somewhere in the middle somewhere. But he gave the entire answer where he broke it down. He talked about his I'm just actually shocked that he said most of the things that he said. And it was amazing in a great. 

Shaan Puri (0:01:32-0:02:09): Way, in a great stories of two companies that he's built, and the stories were phenomenal. We talked about net worth, what he does with his money, how he thinks about investing. We talked about how he kind of went from beginner at business and making all the mistakes to now being really sophisticated and how that all happened in a really short amount of time. We talked about his house, the forever estate, the dream that he's been building around, and how he does hit all the buttons. It had the inspirational, the tactical, the entertaining, the humorous. It had everything that I like in an episode, but in one. So I couldn't be happier right now. 

Sam Parr (0:02:09-0:02:33): So if you use YouTube, whether you're listening on podcasts or you're actually watching us right now, let us know in the comments what you think. Or if you're not a YouTuber, just tweet at Sean and I it's. Sean VP. Like Vice President Sean VP? And then the Sam parr. And add Rob to it and let us know on Twitter. Or if you're a YouTuber, let us know, there I'm very curious what you guys think. And, Tag, Rob, if you can give. 

Shaan Puri (0:02:33-0:02:44): Us a wave of feedback. I'm going to send it all to Rob after the pod to show him the love, because I know people are going to love this. All right, without any further build up, here's the episode with Rob Deird. 

Sam Parr (0:02:45-0:03:00): All right, we're live. Sean, you missed it because you're late. You're always late. And that's his whole thing, is timeliness. And he was talking mad shit about you because you were using his face and his time template that he talked about in the last pod. 

Shaan Puri (0:03:00-0:03:14): I am Human Optimization was the big line from his last time he was on. That's been, I think it's like, in our trailer now. And Rob, if you are human optimization, I am human. On optimization, I am the opposite. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:03:14-0:03:56): Yeah, look, the beauty of time mastery is it's time flexibility and understanding that life is this living experience. But nothing brings me greater joy than to know a man that was using my time data for customer acquisition and knowing that how much I collect my data and how specific I am with mastering my time would be seven minutes. To have me waiting for seven minutes makes life more grand to me. To know that for you, knowing how much I respect and use my time so thoughtfully that you would steal a little bit from me, even, it's fun to me. You know what I mean? It's very fun. 

Shaan Puri (0:03:57-0:04:00): Okay. That is well played. I appreciate that. 

Sam Parr (0:04:00-0:04:37): Dude, we were talking about a bunch of stuff before you hopped in. Rob, I want to talk about that in a second. But you came on, I think, two years ago or a year and a half ago. I don't remember. I just reread the comments a minute ago. Everyone said the same shit, which is the exact same thing, I thought, which was, Rob's just a skater. He's smart and does good TV shit and all that stuff, but we didn't realize that he was just profound. And that pod, I felt like it was like you're coming out as this human optimization thing. Now, I've watched you with so many other people, and I've gone more in depth on some of your stuff. Is that true? Was that like the Artist Formerly known as Prince moment? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:04:38-0:04:40): You guys get all the credit. 

Sam Parr (0:04:40-0:04:42): Thank you. That's what I was looking for. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:04:43-0:06:24): Because let me give you this. You let out with trying to talk to me about you did no depth of research into seeing what I was up to. You let out with some skate talk and TV talk, and then I went on, like, a 20 minutes rant so that you could understand the depth of how I operate. Then the entire conversation changed for an hour. You know what I mean? And that, to me, is like the funniest part of the experience was I said, okay, they have no idea who they're talking to. Let me lay this out real quick. But again, I'm so thankful that the conversation turned to because it was also like I had been collecting the data using my rhythm of existence, but I'd never shared it before. So even then sharing it with you and then you guys reposting it, it really began to create the wave. And then you guys put out a little thing that was about how would Rob monetize his data. And so you put out this entire thing about how to build an app and what I would need to charge in order to create a business out of it. And it really started the wheels in me of realizing that, man, I need to turn this philosophy first into then a usable digital product that's more intuitive, that's deeper than an app, that's actually a software that allows people to realize this level of harmony and overall happiness that I've created through this system, which has led to where I'm at today of continually pushing the philosophy forward and ultimately creating a software was inspired by you guys. 

Sam Parr (0:06:25-0:06:27): We get all the credit. That's nice. 

Shaan Puri (0:06:27-0:07:08): There's actually a couple of listeners who, after they heard that, made their version, they were like, Dude, he was talking about this. It sounded so awesome. He said he might share it, but we haven't seen it yet. So I just went ahead and I made my own version. It's linked to Google Sheets. It was kind of a Janky version, but it definitely inspired many people to look inward and be like, how am I treating my time? And it seems like you had the kind of the complete balance. You were like, I have my time. That's with my wife and my kids, and then I have my work time, and then I have my body. You had it all. So I think that definitely inspired a lot of people to look at it, but it also inspired some people to try to build their own version of that tracker so that they could have the kind of what gets measures, gets managed, that type of attitude around their time. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:07:08-0:08:24): Yeah. And again, I think it's so much more complex than that, right? Because time is alive, and your time and experience, basically your whole life, leads to this present moment in time. And then the energy that you feel at this present moment in time is ultimately the quality of your reality that you're in, right? So time ends up being this much more important aspect of learning to manage. And then you're changing all the time. The world's changing, you're selling companies, you're starting new companies, your kids are growing all these things. So managing your time and how you stay balanced is constantly changing as well as you change. So it's this ongoing focus in my life that it's this constant assessment and adjustment to lead me towards a better probability of a better future experience. And that's what's difficult when somebody makes their own app, there's sort of a philosophy and a rhythm and a process that I'm creating in the software that makes it much more intuitive based off of the type of personality you have and the way your life rolls to get it to actually work. Because otherwise it just feels like you're making checklists and making data, and then it gets too difficult and it's over. 

Sam Parr (0:08:24-0:09:19): Before you join Sean. We are talking about Andrew Huberman. And the reason why we were talking about him is because I like to skate. Rob is a skater, hardcore, obviously, professional skateboarder, and Huberman loves it. And we were talking about that, and I don't know if you know what Momentous is, Sean, but it's like they're one of the main advertisers on the Heberman pod. Andrew heberman says, this is the only protein that I like, so, obviously, I bought a ton. That's what I drink every day. And Rob was like, and is it Jeff? Is he the CEO? I'm supposed to talk to Jeff. Jeff is the CEO? Yeah, I'm supposed to talk to Jeff, because Ken Ride out introduced us, who was also on the pod. And anyway, Rob was like, yeah, that's cool. It's amazing to see how fast that business grew because of Huberman's promotion. I co founded that company not too long ago, and it's just crazy how fast it's grown. And we were like, Wait, what? Rob. You co founded Momentous Protein. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:09:20-0:10:22): Yeah, and look, here's the thing with Momentous Protein. I co founded it with Matt Wan in 2016. When they brought it to me, he had a vision for creating basically the most premium supplements that the market had ever seen. The Ferrari of supplements. It was called Project One at the time, and Matt was foregoing his first year of Harvard to build this company. He was 18 years old, and his father, Mark Wan, had been one of the big investors in my professional skateboarding league. So I had a relationship with him and said I would do this project with his son. First thing we had to do was rebrand it, right, and really create a name and a soul into what is the absolute pinnacle of supplements. Momentous. Right? And all the way down to where I even went through the whole process of even making that logo. To me, that M is like this timeless, extraordinary logo. 

Shaan Puri (0:10:22-0:10:29): And, Rob, that's you in Photoshop, or this is like a creative agency pitching you guys. How does that happen? You take it, make it. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:10:29-0:12:29): This is me literally an illustrator of the agency sent some logos, and me cutting up the agency's logo and being like, no, get rid of there was a circle in the middle. I'm like, no, this is like look at this. It forms like an M and a mountain. I literally cut and pasting in my illustrator, the Momentous logo. Love it. And so we launched that company. And what happens? We don't sell a thing. We don't sell a thing. What do we got? We got the most overpriced protein in the entire industry. It's like 35% above every other protein. Like, literally nobody buys it. Nobody buys it. Now what do you got? You got an 18 year old CEO. This kid doesn't even every single day is another thing of like, oh, that's what happens in business. If you want to talk about the headwinds of no man's land and the pain of launching a business with an 18 year old genius, right? Because he's brilliant, but he was 18 and didn't even understand anything about a company. You can't advise somebody into running a company, you know what I'm saying? You have to fight the fire, learn the battles to ever learn how to operate a company. Long story short, this business never got off the ground for years. And I finally now he's older. I'm like, look, man, you've got to make a decision. You've tried everything. You've done all different types of partnerships. You've made all different types of verticals of product. It is the Ferrari of supplements. It is absolutely the purest and best. You kept it real, but you just can't find a market for it. You either have to sell it, or you have to find somebody to merge with, but you got to move on. You're now 23. You learned everything. Go take this skill set that you learned and apply it to a business that has a more relatively faster growing opportunity. 

Sam Parr (0:12:31-0:12:34): What were the annual sales when you had that conversation? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:12:34-0:12:38): I want to say a few million and just losing money year over year. 

Sam Parr (0:12:38-0:12:41): And how much did you put into it to start? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:12:41-0:12:53): I put in shoot, I want to say not much. Like 200,000 in the first, like, at the beginning to get it off the ground, and another 100,000, 300,000, maybe. 

Sam Parr (0:12:53-0:12:55): Do split equity when you do that. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:12:55-0:14:56): And I got 30% of the business. Okay, now, man raised so much capital any which way but loose. Now I'm on the board. I'm in board meetings. I'll tell you what. Nothing as painful as board meeting after board meeting when there's no revenue growth and you're just burning capital trying to figure out how you're going to tell a story to raise more capital to keep the dream alive. That went on for a significant amount of time. We got incredibly diluted, and then it was just like, hey, man, you've got to make a decision here on what your life looks like. Forget about this company. Forget about this investment. You forego going to Harvard to build this company. So you essentially stepped away from this big education, which always like, in the beginning, I was like, this kid's too smart to go to school. Why he should just go start a company. He doesn't need to go to school. As I have kids and I'm older, like, 78 years later, I'm like, Man, I was like the bad uncle. By advising him to not go to Harvard and I'll do this company with you, gasped him up. Right. I think he should have went to Harvard in hindsight, but again, diluted all the way down. He went out and found Amped, the business that Jeff was running at the time that I actually, man, I looked at in 2015 and almost did a deal to own half of PR lotion and the Amped product because of how much I believed in the IP of what they developed, because it was built through this biopharma group that I was doing deals with back in 15 in my early days of hustling. And they merged. And in that merger, then they did a deal. Now they're joint companies that the whole company becomes momentous, and then they lock in that humor bin deal, and then the business exploded overnight. Overnight. Wow.

Rob Dyrdek (0:15:45-0:16:42): Man? Like 20 times. Right. It is now poised to now make a real run, and I would attribute it to the one for one media to consumer that Andrew Huberman was to the product. Right. So we could never find an audience. It didn't matter how much ad spends we did where we spent it. We had deals with NFL teams and MLB teams and all these athletes and all this stuff, but it was when it finally landed with someone whose core media is their authenticity in the science side of human optimization. Then he's saying, hey, Andy has this massive platform. Then he's saying, this is the very best supplements, because they are, in fact, the very best supplements. When you tie those together, boom, that thing goes. 

Shaan Puri (0:16:42-0:16:44): That's an amazing story. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:16:44-0:17:13): What do I have now? I don't know. What do I have now? Like, 4%, you know what I mean? So now call it nine years later, I already gave up on the brand. Don't even claim it. Looked at it when they merged as an exit, and now it's just, like, completely exploded. And yes, I'll get a return on my 300,000 that would be significant to probably a regular investor. But for me, in the co founding. 

Shaan Puri (0:17:13-0:17:14): Game could have been. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:17:14-0:17:39): I looked at selling that business for 100 million in under five years and having 20% of it when I measured that out in 16 versus selling it eight years later and making a million dollars wherever, I end up getting diluted on the end and like, okay, cool, you got like two and a half times your money. But that's not why you play the game of venture creation. 

Shaan Puri (0:17:40-0:18:05): I think that was my perfect that might be the favorite story that's ever been shared on this pod for a couple of reasons. One, you told it great. Two, it had all the drama, the elements to it. And three, you're very honest. Most people that come on this pod were like, how much did you put in? They're like, handwave it's doing well now. And then they're like, yeah, it's doing well, but they won't say that last part. Which is like, yeah, but it's been eight years, I got diluted. And honestly, I'll make kind of fuck all on this. 

Sam Parr (0:18:06-0:18:06): Really? 

Shaan Puri (0:18:06-0:18:55): The game I'm in, that's good. But the game I'm in is to create X very honest. I want people to appreciate that because we've done 100 plus guests of people that are from all walks of life, people that are post economic, they already made it. They have no incentive to not fully be honest with the situations. And it is very rare to hear that. So I really, really like that. I got two follow ups for you on things you said there. The first is you said you kind of think maybe he should have gone to Harvard. And I think there's an interesting question that applies to a lot of people, which is like, should I go to college? I kind of feel like people who make it, they're like, that's not where you learn it. You learn it in the real world. It sounds like you were kind of in that boat, but you said you change your mind as you've maybe matured or with your own kids. What's the thinking there? He should have gone to Harvard because the company wasn't working? Or you came to appreciate something else about the value of college. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:18:56-0:19:08): I think I've come to appreciate the value of college above all. And as someone who quit high school and started his first company at 17, you know what I mean? I think about the but do you. 

Sam Parr (0:19:08-0:19:12): Appreciate college or Harvard and top 20 colleges? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:19:12-0:20:53): Well, Harvard obviously has a higher level of prestige. But what I never understood, even back then, was the looking at business in a multidimensional way. Learning everything about business, understanding product and supply chain, understanding brand and marketing and customer acquisition, understanding management and hiring and teams and understanding sales and then understanding operational side. Really understanding the financial side, knowing that all of those have to integrate into a financial model that you've got to believe you can execute. Because that's how a business actually becomes successful is when you project what you're going to do when you actually do it. Not project a fantasy so you can raise money. Right. And I think that going to business school, you at least leave with the fundamentals of that and have a general knowledge that when you step out into the real world and really try to build a company, you're at. Least going to have a foundation of what you're launching off of versus what he did. What I did when I was launching all these companies when I was young, all the way into my 30s. Or what he did at 18. You have such little general knowledge of how it all works because you're such an optimist, especially when you're really smart. You can figure things out fast, but there's just too many things that you don't know when it comes to the complexities of building something like a business. 

Shaan Puri (0:20:53-0:21:26): Right. And then my second question was, this is a little nerdy on the protein side, but how did you actually go about creating the cleanest supplement? Because I've thought about this many times, which is there is definitely a market for people who want the highest quality, purest grade, best for you product and they'll pay the extra $20 per bag to get it. And when you look I think the supplement industry is notoriously dirty. The places where they make stuff, if you test these things, they don't turn out very well. So did you guys do anything radical to actually achieve that result? Or was it just finding the right partner? And then that was it. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:21:27-0:22:40): It was first, like, the people who helped develop it, right. We're all like trainers for the 49, ers and the Celtics. Right. Then it's all the certifications that make the I can't think of their exact name, like Grass and Info Sport, whatever, these intrasport, whatever they may be, but these certifications that are very expensive, right. So now the layer of what does that do? Man, that just keeps putting pressure on price and margin, because there's just a certain point where it's like, man, it's so expensive, more expensive. Do even the people that really care, is it making enough of a difference for the absolute premium? And to me, absolutely, we'd find a consumer. And that consumer never showed up until Huberman said to that audience which converted Sam, and now has Sam talking to Jeff. It's like that level of authenticity, the product backed that up, but we never found that level of media that could validate it to reach a large enough consumer base that would be willing to pay that extra amount of money. It's a dice roll when you launch a business to do it like that. 

Sam Parr (0:22:40-0:22:42): We need to get in the certification business, I think. 

Shaan Puri (0:22:42-0:23:11): Yeah, that sounds like the real business. This is cruelty free certified inc. We will certify everything for you for the low, low price. By the way, it's funny that Joe Rogan is like Bro. Oprah. But now Tuberman is like Dr. Phil or Dr. Oz or something of this. Kind of like the guy media game where if the doc says this is the way to go, if he says this is clean, he can move a lot of product, like an unbelievable amount of product in a short amount of time. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:23:11-0:23:59): But look, it's like when you think about the depth of him and how he approaches it, you know, how deep it is. So it's like he's earned that respect from you. You don't question whether or not Nike is going to put as much effort and innovation as they possibly can into a running shoe. You don't even look into the technology. You pick the color and which one feels the good. You know, that they're going to do all the work to get it there. Developing that level of authenticity is incredibly difficult because there's a lot of other people that are Huberman esque that do not have his depth, which in turn does not allow or his process that you believe in, which in turn doesn't allow them to carry the same weight that he does. 

Sam Parr (0:23:59-0:24:05): And that was probably just a straight cash deal when you guys bought that ad spot, I would imagine, right? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:24:06-0:24:28): Yeah. I'm not entirely sure I was involved in the company at that point. I'm not entirely sure what his deal is, but whatever it is, he got underpaid whatever it is, it was too little. Look, I am not privy to what it is, but whatever it is, they got a deal, you know what I mean? 

Shaan Puri (0:24:29-0:24:39): What are some other venture creation that you've been up to? That was one amazing venture creation story. You got me hungry for another. Do you got any other interesting things you cooking? 

Sam Parr (0:24:39-0:24:43): And how many have you even done? You've done dozens of these? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:24:43-0:26:19): Yeah, I've done a bunch. I've done a bunch. You know what I mean? And here's the beauty of it too, is, like, I've made so much money that you can play the game more honest, but you're judging yourself off of your IRR. But once you get to a certain point, you're playing the game for the speed of the IRR and the scale of the IRR and its potential. Because when I started the game, I wanted to build 50 to 70 companies and make own 25 to 35 and sell them for between 50,000,150 million and make 20 to 30 each. But when you sell a company for 200 million and get 150,000,000, you're like, well, that's way more fun. How do I move this number from 15 to 30 million a deal to 50 to 200 million a deal, right? You just begin to change as you're sort of evolving and what, do less deals you want to do less deals, right? And then you want to be much more focused on the opportunity and then focused on all the lessons learned. Would I start a supplement brand with an 18 year old ever again? I would not. You know what I mean? Let me give you an example of an opposite version, right? So I was approached by a really seasoned CEO who had just built a company and sold. It was a footwear brand called Great. Okay. 

Sam Parr (0:26:21-0:26:23): I also owned a pair of those, man. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:26:23-0:29:11): Right? So you understand him as a brand and him as a brand builder and as a CEO. And he had an idea he wanted to share with us, and it was in the beauty space, and he essentially presented to us this concept of filtered shower water is this overlooked cornerstone of creating your beauty routine. Like, your water is filled with all this garbage that dries out your hair and dries out your skin and does all this stuff. Yet for some reason, no one's approached beauty and filtering the water. Right? So we do all the and again, so, okay, wow, this is super interesting. Then now you look at it from a business model, right? Then it's like, oh, wow. Now it's reoccurring revenue. So it's a single bit of hardware that now the filters have to be replaced. So now you've got this reoccurring revenue. Now it's a super experienced CEO that has a depth of knowledge in DTC. So it's not like a lot of times you'll find an experienced CEO that came from retail who just, oh, I want to build an Amazon business, right? Because retail is so hard. Anytime you find people trying to transition to what they think is an easier way to create sales is always a red flag. But again, now he has the understanding, the knowledge, and now it's like, is this space valid? So we do the research. What do we do? We go and look at the entire space of all of the filtered shower heads, the entire market. It is tiny, tiny, tiny, under a billion dollars, right? And he wants to charge $135 for the unit, $35 for the filters. You can go to Home Depot and get a shower filter for, like, $19. There's, like one premium one that's sold by a beauty company that's kind of chromey or whatever. That's like $99, $100, but no movement. And so when you look at that opportunity, you look at it like it's as clear as can be, where it's like, man, this is either pure white space and there is a real opportunity to make this matter in beauty and make a massive business, or it will literally just not work. It is so pure. But then the tantalizing side is, well, boy, if it works, man, think of the friction it takes to get a shower head in. But, man, think of how low the churn will be on the subscription because it'll. Be way more friction to take it completely out, to stop your reoccurring, like subscription every two months and put back your old shower head that made it this incredibly compelling concept. 

Sam Parr (0:29:12-0:29:24): And by the way, for the listener, this is basically your showerhead. I don't even think most people know this, but the showerhead, it's not that hard to remove. You can kind of do it yourself. Jolie. Is this jolie? Is that how you say it? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:29:24-0:29:25): Jolie. 

Sam Parr (0:29:25-0:30:10): Jolie. And basically they give you because I've seen this company, they killed it in year one. I think they did 4 million in sales in the first year. Basically, they send you a thing, a new showerhead, they send you a wrench. You put it on there, and then you put little, like, filters and packets, and I think they smell nice or something like that. And they might have some type of other good stuff in there. But the premise is that for all the really hardcore health nerds, they're afraid of some of the chemicals and minerals that are in city water. And so they want this to be better. And I have friends that have, like what's that one charcoal water filter that's made out of metal. They do that for their home. They do these really $10,000 projects for their home. And what this product is, is that for a showerhead? Did I summarize that? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:30:11-0:30:29): That's correct. And it's the efficacy of it. Right. And then how did they launch the company? How were they able to go to 4 million and now this year they'll do close to 40 million is that they opened it up by putting in your zip code so you could see all the contaminants in your water. 

Shaan Puri (0:30:29-0:30:29): Nice. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:30:30-0:32:02): So how they did all their initial customer acquisition is they got all the data of what because the water departments have to report all the contaminants in the water. And so they scraped all that data you put in your zip code, and then you got a complete report of all the stuff in your water. That's how they did customer acquisition for months before they even had the product out. You know what I mean? Then they did preorders before it launched. Right? Then what were we all hanging on for? What's that first quarter of churn? The churn was at like 1.2% of the subscription. It's like everything about it. And then it was just growth month over month over month. Then they just keep evolving. They launched an Airwon in the grocery store. They have a giant display, and you can buy them an Airwan, right. It's like the entire process of how they did it overnight. Because you got to think, how do you value a business like that? That business is valued at 200 million plus in a year and a half, because how do you really look at that, where it's like, yes, it's selling hardware month over month, but then it is stacking subscription dollars. So it is this extraordinary hardware subscription service that is incredibly rare that has made it so valuable. Overnight. He built the company with three people where the primary investor? It's profitable and never raised another dime ever again. 

Sam Parr (0:32:03-0:32:06): Chef's Kiss, what size check you do on that one? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:32:07-0:32:10): Yeah, I did 800 in that one. 

Sam Parr (0:32:11-0:32:13): That's substantial. Right. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:32:13-0:32:23): For an early stage startup, I'm all over the place, but I'll go up to 10 million, you know what I mean? So when I think 800, I think it's, like, kind of small. 

Shaan Puri (0:32:23-0:32:29): What's been the biggest bet? Like, where have you plowed in something like 10 million into? What type of bet was that? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:32:30-0:33:48): My professional skateboarding league, my production company, merged with Nitro Circus and created Thrill One Media. And then we sold Thrill One Media for 300 million, of which we got 200 million. Right? And this was sort of like the layering in of my production deal. And then the group that bought Thrill One, I invested 10 million with them to buy me and then did a separate deal as it relates to having a bigger stake in the production company that I sold and my league and the overall sports property. Because I knew during that transaction, I knew I was going to negotiate for a bigger television deal. So I basically leveraged my ability to go and get a lot of value for the company. So I got all this equity back. They just paid me close to 200 million. So I used ten of it to invest in buying me so that I could turn around and hopefully make another not nearly as much, but hopefully like another 100 to 150 off of it a couple of years down the line. 

Sam Parr (0:33:48-0:33:55): When you say we, is that like Deirdre family office or is that you don't have a fund, right? Yeah, it's just your family office. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:33:55-0:36:27): Just my money, yeah. No, this is all my money, and I just run it like a family office. And I just look at that as where I would deploy venture capital, right? So if I just deploy capital into real estate and ventures that I have a much more control over and or I have a higher leverage or position. But it was amazing. Think about this. In the closing of the deal, it was the most money I made in one shot, right? And the most like, I had invested at one shot in a venture. So with the like, here on my closing that deal in the Zoom call, it was the most I made and the most I invested in one. Here, here, whatever. My final check off on was it but again, what are the stakes of it? It's whatever, you know what I mean? I look at it as it's fun. And I'm underwriting the business because I went and signed a massive television deal. So I'm underwriting that entire roll up. And it's amazing. Partners. It's Dana White and the Fertita family who owned the UFC. So it's like even being close to them and knowing them for so long just makes the joy of even partnering with them fun and exciting. And I dedicate very little time to it, right? Like, I still help sort of adding the vision and how to continue to evolve it and grow it. But I continue to shoot television at an even much higher scale. Like, now I'm shooting 336 episodes a year, up from 252. That's still at 4% of my time. That's essentially 5 hours a day, four times a month for ten months, right. Is essentially what it is, but it's underwritten the entire roll up. It is a billion dollar television deal over a seven year period. With the production and everything involved, I get all my talent money, but then I'm also leveraged into the roll up in the production company again to sell it again, and it's just squeezing water out of a rock. You know what I'm saying? It's like you're looking at opportunities inside every deal. There just isn't a world where I'm just looking at, like, where are the ways for me to add leverage, create opportunity in each one of the ways that I look at every one of these deals each and every time. 

Shaan Puri (0:36:27-0:37:01): Who are some of your business advisors, mentors, friends that are helping you develop this muscle? Because anything you want to do, you go from a white belt to blue belt, eventually you can become a black belt. And it sounds like when you started, you were more of a white belt, like, everybody. And now looking at structures, looking at ways to double dip, looking at ways to measure, okay, I want IRR, but also I should be thinking about the gross dollar amounts and maybe fewer deals, but bigger deals. Who have you learned a ton from that you respect either as a friend or a mentor on the business side? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:37:01-0:39:01): Man, I don't think anybody plays the game like this that I know that's in my circle. I think it's that experience, and it's that continually looking at every deal multidimensional, right? And I think the gift that I actually had early on is I used to look at media and marketing multidimensionally, right? So in the early days, I would be able to look at a television show and how are all these ways that I can monetize it, right? Like, how do I own the rights of media? And then I could sell that to different people. I always looked at opportunity multidimensionally, but I didn't understand how to build and create value in business. So I never looked at business multidimensionally. And I just think once I taught myself, really, how to look at business holistically and how to create and build businesses to sell creating value, that then I began to look at. How can I see all of the opportunity in these different angles in order to create the most value for myself and a lot of times underwrite risk, you know what I mean? Like if I didn't know I was going to go and sign that mega television deal, I wouldn't have put into 10 million. But then I said, well what if I go and sign this deal? How much additional equity will you give me for my 10 million? Right? Then they're like, oh, if you go and get that deal then we'll give you twelve extra percent, you know what I mean? Then it's like I just literally overnight made my 10 million worth like 60 million and underwritten it off of a deal that I'm going and making hundreds of millions of dollars to just do. And at the end of it and keep in mind through all of this I work less now than I've ever worked, you know what I mean? Through optimizing my time and getting more and more efficient of how I use it, I work at about a 40 hours week to manage my family office, all of my venture portfolios and shoot television and a podcast. 

Shaan Puri (0:39:01-0:39:13): What do you think you're worth at this point? So you have liquid and you have obviously illiquid. What do you think the N word the net worth is at? And do you have a goal with that? 

Sam Parr (0:39:13-0:39:20): And last podcast you go, I need to be a billionaire like I deserve. So yeah, where are we at? You remember that line? It was a beautiful line. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:39:20-0:40:28): No, I don't. But that's really funny I was doing because you got to think in between our last call, I hired an amazing CEO that came from a family office structure. I needed somebody that understood business but understood sort of the dynamics of a family office, but was also young and excited to go on a journey to a billion dollars, right? And so I have modeling for just my cash flowing assets that take me to a billion. Forget about any of your venture stuff and building out sort of your pathway through the business side. I have modeling out to the year 2050 that I have fully integrated on all asset classes that I'm even investing in now. Where do you make the billion dollars? You make it either slowly over time at compounding or in big chunks. Right? So if today my net worth of all of my assets is a little just under 350,000,000, right? That the pathway there's, the slow long pathway to a billion. That's easy through compounding, right. 

Sam Parr (0:40:29-0:40:32): What do you assume? Just like seven or 8%, correct? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:40:32-0:42:30): Right. And with the buildings now you got to think about the way the buildings work and the real estate work is I'm getting five to 6% cash, like tax free cash, but I'm still getting seven to 10% equity growth over the long term. And some of those are call it with the cash, 15, 16% IRRs. But a lot of the buildings that I've sold, I ended up with like 35 and 42% IRRs. And what do you do with that? You 1031 exchange it and you get new buildings on an ongoing basis so that real estate, even side of it is compounding in a unique way. And then with my cash money markets are giving you 5% right now, close to 5%. And then I keep a significant amount of liquid dollars in sort of nouveine high yield funds that kick off around a blended 10% that aren't going to grow. But you get cash for your cash. You're making so much cash off of your cash, then you're making so much cash, tax depreciated cash off of your real estate portfolio. I look at that, I call it the modern cash flow portfolio, where it's just that cash is underwriting the expense of my life in the family office, right? And so when I have these big exits and when all the money I get made from TV, I look at all of it through the lens of how much am I actually making post tax per hour. So, okay, it seems like I'm making a lot shooting television so efficiently and how much time I actually work on the deer to machine and the actual venture side of the business when you look at long term capital gains versus ordinary income. But boy, when you look at the amount of time I spend on that cash flowing portfolio and real estate, it's a couple of hours a year. 

Shaan Puri (0:42:31-0:42:46): What do you have as a dollar per hour goal? What is good for you, what is bad for you, right? So everybody has if I do something that saves me $100, I go return a blender to the store. That wasn't a saving of $100. It was a loss. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:42:46-0:44:25): I'm looking at a million an hour as the goal. You know what I mean? That's your goal as it relates to energy and effort that's put into it, right? Because it's fascinating when you look at how much money I make from television and then what that ends up being post tax and fees, even though it seems like a limited amount of time because it's only 4% of my time. But seeing all of them through that lens, it's a way more interesting way to view it all, you know what I mean? And again, it goes back to time because what life do you want to live, right? Where do you get time? Where can you buy time back? But ultimately, where are the places where you make the most money and people don't believe in them? Like this idea of passive income. Passive income is not buying a building that you've got to operate and you're constantly dealing with, like trying to keep it rented and things breaking and trying to make decisions. That's not passive income in real estate. Passive income is when you give money to an operator and they give you cash back for your money. That's when you're doing nothing. Now, what you have to get good at is evaluating rules and creating principles for the type of operators you'd be willing to deploy capital with so that you know that they're world class and that what they say they're going to do. That they do, which in turn, all you're doing is reading statements and putting a little bit of time to think through strategy, future strategy, a few times a year. That's the difference on the way you choose to get into an asset class. 

Sam Parr (0:44:25-0:44:51): And based off of the last pod, you were saying how I think you're 47 now, right? I think you said into your late 30s, you'd screwed a whole bunch of shit up. I think when you were trying to raise money from I forget the VC or PE company, but you were raising money for something, and you're like, dude, my business sucks. I'm losing money. Turns out I was wrong. So does that mean that the vast majority of your real wealth creation has been in the last ten years? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:44:51-0:44:54): No, in the last few years. 

Sam Parr (0:44:55-0:44:58): But you were broke. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:44:58-0:45:07): I would consider myself broke. I would say I started from zero almost in 2016 when I launched the machine. I wouldn't say debt broke. 

Sam Parr (0:45:07-0:45:10): I mean, you're a millionaire. Were you worth at least ten? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:45:10-0:45:15): I would say I was probably worth, like, 15 or 20 in that zone. So not broke. But to me, I was like, Bro. 

Shaan Puri (0:45:15-0:45:18): To a future billionaire, a millionaire is broke. 

Sam Parr (0:45:19-0:45:28): Yeah, but he described it. He was like, in my 30s. He's like, I spent this. You said phrases like, I had nothing. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:45:29-0:47:08): But I would tell you that the majority of this wealth was all created between 2018 and 2022 over that four year period. Right. And now it's exponentially scaled. Right. When I think about sort of how I very conservatively value the ventures that get me up to the 325 zone, I could easily say those push me closer to four. Right. But it's also like, then, okay, how do I want to continue to create bigger opportunities in the future? Because I'm always, like, five years into the future, the same way I understood in 2016. Here's the strategy. The strategy worked, only it was bigger than I anticipated. Then all these other additional things had happened. I had the clarity of, like, this is what I was going to do. But then that clarity. The universe conspired to create more opportunity that I capitalized off of and got to this scale that I could have never imagined in such a shorter amount of time. And all it does is make me see further and clearer on how I can get the scale even bigger. Which leads me to believe, compounding, I become a billionaire over time. But I believe I can create some ventures, including the software that I create and the platform that I want to build to speak to that core audience that I believe I will be able to monetize it at a much higher scale in a shorter amount of time with my existing portfolio of assets. 

Sam Parr (0:47:08-0:47:29): And if you Google your name, you'll see, like, you went on a little bit of a buying spree where you're buying, like, I think, four really nice homes in La. But I thought there was a quote saying, you're not going to live there. That's rentals. A, is that true? And B, what type of real estate are you actually buying that you consider cash flowing real estate versus just personal? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:47:29-0:47:32): Yeah. So I would never buy a house of rent. 

Sam Parr (0:47:32-0:47:40): Yeah, I didn't think so. I thought it said that maybe it was, like on the what's it called? Like the dirt or like the real something like that. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:47:41-0:49:52): Yeah. Really? What I did and this will give you an clarity on how much money I had and how dumb I was in 2015. Okay. I had met my wife. All I wanted to find was a forever home. I had realized in 14, like, I had began to develop learning everything about business and everything. You got to think in 2013, I was dumb as dirt. I was at the bottom. I didn't understand business. I didn't understand anything. I hired all the consultants and all the groups and began to formulate everything I needed to learn to speak the way I'm speaking today and the strategies of what money is, where do I want to invest it. Never even heard of multifamily units in 2014. Right. I then took all of my money. At the time I had all the money I had to my name. In 2015, it was $12 million in cash. Moved it all to cash because I had money in all these different brokers. It didn't know what it was. Here I am in 2015 with a vision for how I'm going to create a venture studio, the Deer Deck machine and the whole thing. And I'm looking for a forever home or a place to buy, and I find the most heaven sent piece of land that God has ever created in a gated community in Beverly Hills. That is this gated community to a private road to a four acre promontory with unobstructed views of the entire La Basin Hollywood, sign of the most extraordinary property I have ever stepped on in my life. And paid 10 million cash for it. And then took launched this dream with 2 million because I was like, oh, man, this is my destiny to build a house and live on this land forever. 

Sam Parr (0:49:52-0:49:53): It was just land. It was just land. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:49:54-0:51:06): Just land. Call it forever estates. And I have since. And so in that neighborhood, like where it is, I have bought multiple houses and remodeled them in the neighborhood while I continue to design Forever Estates, as it's called, and kept it all these years. Carried the cost, 200 grand a year. Just to carry it spending. Like, built a whole designed a whole house of the architecture team, fired them, hired Seyota, the best architects in the world, out of South Africa. And we have just been designing and designing and designing. It was part of the vision of, like, I'm going to spend the rest of my life in Forever Estates. That's where I'm going to live. There is no better piece of land in the city of Los Angeles. It's the most extraordinary home. I rented a house for three and a half years, bought a house for 6.5, sold it for, like, nine, five, two years later, after remodeling it, bought another house for eight, put 2 million into it. This house that I'm in now is two doors down from the entrance to Forever Estates. So when I begin to build it in the fall, that I can be there every step of the way. But what happens? 

Shaan Puri (0:51:06-0:51:15): Hold on. Begin to build it in the fall? How long are we of timeline are we talking? This has been eight years and we're beginning to build it. This is the Forever Take Forever Estates. 

Sam Parr (0:51:15-0:51:16): Yeah. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:51:17-0:52:29): What does the world say to me? They're like, this is crazy. And I'm like, man, I'm going to live there forever. And when I build it, I don't even want to think about the cost. It's going to cost me 20 million to build. I don't even want to think about it. I needed to get to generational level wealth to even like, I didn't want it to be a burden. That's why I kept buying houses and kept working on the design. And then now you've gotten to such a scale. What's the strategy now? Well, I'm putting it into a trust. I'm paying cash for the house to build it, and then I'm going to pay rent to the trust, and then it's going to build an endowment so that this home can be in my family forever. But run it be self operational so it doesn't have to be tied to the estate that it will be ran. And then there can be family meetings in Forever Estates for hundreds and hundreds of years into the future. Right. And you can't even get to that way of thinking unless you have kids, unless you create generational wealth, unless you get to that time. But that all happened over five year period. That is an extraordinary transition to go. 

Sam Parr (0:52:29-0:52:32): It started with a horrible decision. I mean, ten. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:52:35-0:53:40): Look, I could have put ten think I'm going to say, you know how much money I had invested in buildings in 2015? 100,000. 100,000. I had invested 100,000 and was making seven G's from that one. Instead of putting 10 million into a cash flow, which I would have been set for life if I would have put that 10 million into the buildings that I put back in 2015 that got like 40% IRRs, and we're kicking off like 9% cash, I would have been set for life from the compounding and the cash flow of that one thing. Oh, no. I took ten, put it straight into a liability, saying that now I'm carrying the cost of paying the taxes and double homeowners fee because it's a double lot. So I'm just carrying 200 grand a year. And then I'm paying all these architects on an ongoing basis to continue to design and develop. It absolutely ludicrous. 

Sam Parr (0:53:41-0:53:56): You're amazing. Are you taking adoption? I think you're 15 years older than me. I could be your teenage yeah, I want to go to Forever Estates, man. Forever Estates for you is going to be more like a decade estate. It sounds like the way it's taken. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:53:57-0:53:59): And look, even hey, if it lasts. 

Shaan Puri (0:53:59-0:54:01): Forever, what's a decade, man? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:54:01-0:55:05): That's a drop in the bucket. But think about it. It seems to me it's just another part of seeing my life completely and multidimensionally, because it's like it's my relationship with my wife and kids in time. It's the health that I have. It's how every part of my existence has continued to expand and get better. I didn't get better in just business. I got better in all aspects of my existence on an ongoing basis. So that house, if I would have built the house I designed five years ago, I would have been so bummed because I got every six months, I would get a completely new design, get it in VR. And as I changed and thought about and got clear on what I wanted the future to look like and how I would want family meetings here in 200 years, it allowed me to keep evolving. And keep evolving to where when I finally got to this point where I'm just about to get the final permits, it feels right on time to me. 

Shaan Puri (0:55:05-0:55:06): I love that. 

Rob Dyrdek (0:55:06-0:55:42): Right? And it's like I'm healthier, happier, wealthier, wiser. And I know that I'm just going to get healthier, happier, wealthier and wiser till the day that I die. And right now, what's my goal? 1 million hour of life. 114 years and 54 days. So where am I spending a significant amount of my wealth understanding every single aspect of my body and having a very deep longevity plan that allows me to enjoy life and live it at a high level at the ripe old age of 112? Someone get to 114, just fall off a cliff. 

Shaan Puri (0:55:45-0:55:51): Oh, my God, Rob, you're amazing. So I was going to ask you about longevity. Like perfect segue, right? 

Sam Parr (0:55:51-0:56:20): Yeah, I want to ask about that too. And what I was going to say is very similar to that, which is when I sold my first business and had my first bite of financial success, I was able to get physically fit. It was definitely a little bit easier. I could hire some people, but also I felt a little bit more calm and I had more time. Is this new focus on longevity and focus on all this stuff. Is that because you now are financially successful and have more time? Or do you think that you always had this bug and what are you doing now, health wise? 

Rob Dyrdek (0:56:21-1:00:15): I have been doing it nonstop for as long, for 20 years. I got my first blood panel and started optimizing into my blood work in 2012. So for me, where a big transition was in 2015, around the same time, I had made the decision that I was in the best shape of my life, but my body was always achy. And I had made this decision that I started having a doctor come to my house five days a week, and all I wanted to do was build a perfectly structured physical system. And there was no timeline to it. And really what it led to is triangulating, a ton of different therapies, but in the process allowed me to learn every muscle in my body how the fascia system works, what are my neurological deficiencies? What are all of the things that I need to retrain in my overall system internally as it relates to leaky gut and blood, brain barrier, all of these sort of things that lead to inflammation, that lead to heart disease, and all these different things that reduce your quality and length of life. I had been doing over a decade. So now the way I approach it is so sophisticated because I know every single aspect of my entire function holistically of my body, my mind, my time, my energy. So it's a different level. So what happened when I got to this scale of success? I refer to it as peak top. It's the same psychological chaos that happens to a drug addict at rock bottom, where you finally make shift in you, where you can't be a drug addict anymore and something shifts in you mentally. It happened to me on the other side where you started getting more and more disciplined and healthy that you all of a sudden were like, why would I ever not just be extraordinarily healthy for the rest of my life? And what happened from that point? I have not missed the day of getting up at 05:00 a.m.. I have not missed a day in the gym. I have not missed one day meditating. I have not missed one day eating supplements, eating clean. I have not had a drink. I haven't had any sugar. I haven't had a snack, any of that since I hit that like nine months ago. The data that I shared with you guys as it relates to the quality of my life numbers, how I feel about my life work and health, zero to ten. And then my discipline numbers, what percentage did I get up at? Five brain train meditate, get in the gym, eat clean and not drink and take my supplements. It is 100% across this entire year. And then my qualitative. Numbers are at the highest they've ever been. So every single day I wake up feeling extraordinary, right? And I grew into that. And then the more success I had, I didn't have to then decide I want to be healthy. I had been working in 2016 when I designed my vision for my business and my financial success. I designed a vision for my life success and my health success. So what happened over the last seven years is I got better and better and better at all of it, which led to this euphoric state of where you have an incredible depth of knowledge of your entire reality and your current state and your future state. So you're just continuously predicting the future and creating higher probabilities of being healthier, happier and wealthier in the future while living extraordinary in the present. 

Sam Parr (1:00:15-1:00:22): What's been like the 80, 20 of that? Like, the things that have made the biggest change on your health. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:00:22-1:01:11): I mean, look, not drinking, not eating sugar and intermittent fasting and eating a lean protein and vegetable meal, to me, is everything. Is everything. Because your body begins to clean itself. You feel better about yourself. You make sharper decisions. You go two layers deeper. Your emotions are more in check. Like, things happen inside the family, different things that are uncontrollable. You're able to control all of those better. That just pure diet alone. In avoiding all of these processed foods and alcohol, in being committed to that, will absolutely change your life because it gives your mind more depth to be able to execute at a higher amount at a higher level in the limited amount of time that you have to execute. 

Shaan Puri (1:01:11-1:01:14): Sir, have you seen this guy? Brian Johnson? What he's doing? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:01:14-1:01:24): Look I look at Brian Johnson as this guy's outrageous. It's too much. But I withhold my judgment because if I would have told myself five years. 

Sam Parr (1:01:24-1:01:25): Ago, hey, this is what you're going. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:01:25-1:01:35): To be doing, I'd be like, that guy's crazy. So I look at I feel like Brian Johnson's crazy, but I'll probably turn into Brian Johnson in like, seven or eight years. 

Sam Parr (1:01:36-1:01:38): He's wild, man. He's wild. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:01:38-1:01:44): Yeah. Brian Johnson just has that look, you know what I mean? He looks like a futuristic, like, amoeba. You know what I mean? 

Shaan Puri (1:01:44-1:01:53): That's what I was thinking. I looked up the other day, I'll go, all he needed, all he needs to do is tan. If he tans, everybody like, this guy's amazing. He doesn't tan and they're like, you're a vampire, bro. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:01:54-1:02:03): He looks like AI. All like the new AI versions of people coming out. He looks like an AI. Person. He might not even be real. He might not even be real. 

Shaan Puri (1:02:03-1:02:05): He's a mid journey. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:02:05-1:02:46): But I do look at that aspect because you've got to think about anything. Think about the way that I talk about business. It's knowledge and experience and an understanding, and then a continual evolution and growth of understanding the whole, like, applying that to my relationship with my wife and family, applying that to my health, applying that to business, applying that to investment, applying that to building my family office. All of that way of thinking is based off of gaining knowledge. To take something from not understanding in it, feeling difficult, to then making it easier, then continually optimizing it. Right. You're just incrementally making it all better. 

Shaan Puri (1:02:46-1:03:31): I love the way you think, and I love the kind of pursuit of greatness and pursuit of excellence for yourself and having a vision for yourself. I also know that it's inspiring but also hard to relate to perfection. And so I'm curious, what are the current flaws or bugs in your software that you're still debugging? We all have some bugs in our software that's running. We're hunting them down, and we're trying to squash them one at a time. What are some that are still in your system? It might be in business. It might be in health. For me, a nice bag of chips is still a bug in my software. Maybe something sometimes when I'm with my wife, I'm not as present as I should be. I'm on my phone, but I know that's not really me and who I'm going to be, but I'm still catching up to myself in that way. What are some of those for you? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:03:32-1:03:37): And this is going to sound like extraordinarily don't say it. 

Shaan Puri (1:03:37-1:03:42): I tried to help you, man. I tried to serve you up a way that you vulnerable here. No. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:03:42-1:03:43): Again. 

Sam Parr (1:03:46-1:03:49): I'm not racist. But this is like your teeth. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:03:50-1:07:37): Yeah. No, to me it is. I still get triggered and will get angry when my expectations are mismanaged at a high level, I'll get mad and get in Snap. Right. I'm not even kidding you. Even when I get triggered, I'm trying to stop the triggers to avoid saying something like letting it come out. Right. But I still feel the trigger. My goal is to get to don't even let things trigger you. Like, when you let people get angry. But you got to think part of the evolution is like, there's certain people in your life that do that to me that I had to let go of. Right. And continually optimize for those people. And this is embedded in my soul. This is embedded in my soul. When I feel stuck, when I feel stuck, when I'm working on trying to do deep work or doing something and I feel stuck, all I want is pizza and wine. All I want is pizza and wine. It's not even, like, a matter of acting on it. It's like my soul feels like it needs a glass of wine, because whenever I get stuck, it's this psychological thing of like, just fuck let it all go. Let it all go. So even though I don't act on it because I've just evolved beyond it, I still when I get stuck. The feelings exist in there. But I'm telling you, the commitment of where it went 100% health and no alcohol and no sugar in that level, it eliminated so many things. It eliminated me being short with people, it eliminated me, like, making rash decisions, right? Not thinking through stuff and just shooting from the hip, which is a recovery. I used to say, Deirdeck Enterprises, our money's fearless, right? Because I would invest so recklessly when it was really, our money's dumb, but that reckless. Like, let's just push it forward. Let's just start it and go for it is still something that I fight on an ongoing basis because I'll get excited and energized and see it and be like, let's do it. And I've got to control that impulse that I've learned to control in this state at a much higher level, but there are very little. And here's the thing. I look at it as, like, how Kobe was relatable to me because it was too much discipline, and how Tom Brady like, man, why would you not take the offseason off? I used to look at that as this impossible level, and to me, I know that I'm reaching this unrelatable, unattainable place. It's why I put out a podcast earlier this year that was the most unrelatable podcast, part one and part two, because I just laid out the depth of actually how I'm operating and what I've learned along the way to get to this level. Because I want to be the proof that you can get to a place where you never get angry, you never have a negative thought, where you are completely harmonious and balanced in all your relationships and time and health and happiness, where you are happy and filled with gratitude seven days a week, every single day, even under unexpected duress. I'm living it, and I know it's possible. I want to continue to be proof that it is. Then I want to build the products, services, and tools that other people can use to get to this level and this feeling, because to me, it is heaven on earth. It is true. Happiness is really the output of this existence that I've created in a relatively short amount of time. 

Sam Parr (1:07:38-1:09:05): Let me run this trend by you guys that I'm seeing, and it's related to this. So I live part of the time in New York, most of the time in Austin, Texas, and I also own a ranch out in Texas. And what I'm noticing is that Austin is almost like La a little bit, where we have all types of health freaks. It's really cool to be around those types of people. And I eat really healthy as well. And I'm noticing that my extreme help friends, they're doing something like a redneck family, like where I grew up, what they used to do, which is they buy a cow. So you go in with either you or your neighbor, and you go and purchase a cow and someone slaughters it, and then you get the whole cow for the year. And I noticed that zuckerberg, I think two years ago he made this commitment that he was only going to eat what he killed or I think even grew. And I'm noticing that my health friends are doing this now. And I've seen a lot of tweets recently where people saying, like, you know, I'm eating healthy, but I still feel bad. But when I go to Europe, I feel good. And I did some research. The FDA and the European, the EU, how they measure food, it's a little bit differently, like the preservatives and things. Anyway, I know you're into health now, and I know you invest in a lot of health and wellness stuff. My prediction is that in the next five or ten years, I think we're going to see a couple of brands where you can buy meat online. I'm even seeing people, like, revolt against Whole Foods meat. Do you eat just meat off the shelf from Whole Foods or do you get it from somewhere special? Because I think there's going to be an interesting brand that does this the next five or ten years. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:09:05-1:09:21): Yeah, look, my meat is not so special to me. How I do it? How do I do it? I get meal delivery seven days a week. Right. 

Sam Parr (1:09:21-1:09:23): From which brand? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:09:23-1:09:31): It's just a local chef here that's all organic. Right. Grass fed. And so I get a salad. 

Sam Parr (1:09:31-1:09:32): Grass fed beef. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:09:33-1:09:33): Yeah. 

Sam Parr (1:09:35-1:09:36): It tastes so bad, man. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:09:36-1:10:46): Yeah. To me, that's my baseline. And then I have breakfast Wednesdays with my wife. I have Friday night pasta with my wife, sunday night sushi. I have sort of the rhythm of dates that I take my wife on. And so when I look at that particular protein, if you will, at this stage, like I look at that as much as I'm willing to dedicate into what's in my body until I can get to a point where the data shows me the impact of having Daisy in the backyard and me cutting Daisy up and slicing off a rib is going to deliver more nutrients. That's going to add to a longer, higher quality of life. I would need the data to take me there one day as opposed to getting that nuanced and the delivery of the quality of that protein, where at this point, for me, that's enough as it relates to what I'm capable and my personal capacity can dedicate to the quality of the food. 

Sam Parr (1:10:46-1:11:01): I think this is going to be a thing. Sean, have you not know there's a company that just raised money from Peter Thiel? It's called Coop, and they're making the Tesla of chicken coops. So normal people can have a chicken coop in their backyard, I believe any trend. 

Shaan Puri (1:11:01-1:11:04): Yeah, that the guy. Coop guy. He's the eye crack guy, right? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:11:04-1:11:04): Same guy, yeah. 

Sam Parr (1:11:04-1:11:07): AJ. Dude, I'm so fascinated with this. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:11:07-1:11:16): Look, listen, right now, fundamentally, would you have your own chickens that you slaughtered and ate chickens if it was no. 

Sam Parr (1:11:16-1:11:40): It'S for the eggs. It's for the eggs. It's for the eggs. Eggs make sense, bro. You just told me that a shower head company is going to be worth billions, okay? And you just bought a $10 million piece of land. You might have an air. In your judgment, things happen. I know your biggest weakness is you sick of the shower, but come on. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:11:40-1:12:52): Yeah, look for eggs maybe, but I don't know. When you look at trends on an ongoing basis, you refine your lens of the things that were improbable that ended up working when they're harder to see. You know what I mean? I think my even lens always ties back to the probability of the unit economics and the reoccurring revenue aspect of it. I look at it so much more through that lens. Because even when I think about the coupe, if you're selling a single unit hardware now you've got this incredibly small customer base in the very beginning that are the ultra healthy and then it's like a mattress. Like in the direct to consumer mattress game. As soon as they buy one, they don't need another one for 15 years. Right. It would suffer that same sort of consequence versus five years ago. Coop would get 100 million dollar valuation based off of like there's going to be coupes in every house in the world. It's innovation. It's like the Tesla of eggs. 

Shaan Puri (1:12:53-1:12:53): Right. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:12:53-1:13:13): My lens isn't as refined and I always go back to how much revenue the idea can create from a long term value perspective versus those tough hardware businesses that are minimal margin and you sell warrant. 

Sam Parr (1:13:14-1:13:23): So what trends interest you now? What do you think so to be popular in the next five years? And where are you investing your money for? What interesting trends are you looking to invest in? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:13:23-1:15:25): Yeah, look, I don't invest in anything. I invest in real estate and businesses that I create. And right now, I haven't even invested in a new venture since Jolie. Because to me, I do think when I look out into the future as it relates to the type of stuff that I would do would still be related to biofeedback, health, customization, all of these things that help lead you to optimizing your overall health and well being. I do think you got to think those glucose monitors that sort of come out to kind of give you an indication of what your blood sugar is doing when you're eating food, that they're going to evolve that to eventually become dopamine and cortisol, and it's going to end up being a cornerstone of how your life is actually feeling based off of what your blood is saying in real time. I think that's going to be something that really makes a big impact on the world to me. I want to time into creating the existence management system that helps you manage how all of it fits together to lead to your present moment in time and help you optimize for guiding your life to creating higher energy present moments that you use with purpose. And whether that's to be on your phone and watch TV with your wife because you're tired, or it's for you to be ultra present with your kids so that you can actually experience it, or you want to be able to design use the present to design a better future for yourself. It's really about how do you become this healthy, develop healthy and understanding and the knowledge of yourself. Develop the ultra awareness of everything about you so that you can continually live a consistent state of joy. Because feeling joy over long periods of time is what it creates. The feeling of happiness. 

Sam Parr (1:15:26-1:15:38): Sean, we could wrap up with whatever you want to, but I know that people in the comments are going to be like, why is that Douchebag bringing up me? What the fuck? I already know they're going to flame me in the YouTube comments. I was just curious. 

Shaan Puri (1:15:39-1:16:37): Rob, I wanted you to can you finish with a two minute crash course on something I've been interested in and you know very well, which is production companies. So I noticed. I don't know anything about Hollywood or TV production, but my ears perked up when I forgot who was they bought Reese Witherspoon's production company for some hundreds of millions of dollars. Then I saw that Peter Chernon from the Chernon Group, he's doing a roll up of production companies. He's put in a billion dollars to work rolling up production companies. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. I read some interviews and he's talking about why he thinks there's a growing and sort of insatiable demand for content. And then I just look at people who create Netflix shows. I go look at? Oh, love is blind. It's ranked number one on Netflix. Who created this? I was a small production company. Is this like the startup game where you create the next hit show and you become a billionaire? Or is it a ruthless business? Can you just describe what creating a show or creating a production company is like and if that's a good business to be in or not? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:16:37-1:21:47): As someone who sold their production company for 200 million and who had an offer on the table that fell apart for 400 million recently, it is the worst business that you could ever get in in your life. And I'll explain to you why. It is a shoot what you kill game and the distributors control all of the money. So you have a hit show and you have this flourishing production company, and then the show gets canceled and your company's worth zero. Right? And then the problem with shows is they don't pick them up for long periods of time. I have a five year, one 6000 hundred and 80 episode order of television. It is unprecedented in all of production. It does not exist. But why is it hard for me to turn around and sell that? Because it's one single show. And now they look at the and it's so expensive because it's made the the production company so profitable. But let's just say that didn't push you away. A production company is built like this, right? You've got to build the infrastructure that allows you to have your camera equipment, your finishing equipment, your licensing for your music. You've got to basically then go and give a budget to a network who's going to give you 500 grand for an episode. And now you have got to figure out how to pull 20% to 30% of that in margin, right? So it gets incredibly difficult to do and the only way that you can do that is look at all of the different ways that you can scrape margin out of that budget by owning, vertically integrating. So a lot of times there'll be people that have television shows and they just get paid an executive producer fee, right? So they will make a lot of money. Like Jeff Tremaine, who is one of the executive producers on my show, makes millions off of Ridiculousness and just off his executive producer fee. Nothing. Where we rolled in our executive producer fees then built out the entire post and finishing and music division to push our margins up to be able to create a sellable asset. Then we had multiple shows and then call it the long term sustainability of ridiculousness created the value that allowed us to sell it, right? And so even if you launch a production company and you have Love is Blind and it's a hit show, you're not making that much money off of that show. You are now hoping to stack shows and then end up pulling off of that margin that you get to split, right? And then you trade on EBITDA, right? So when you sell the business you're trading at like six times EBITDA. Five, six times EBITDA and then a lot of times now they won't even buy you outright. They will partner with you, incentivize your long term earnout because they don't want to just pay you five times, six times your EBITDA and then all of a sudden the show goes away. And you were the creative force behind getting new shows, right? So it's a lot more complex. And when you think about the big dogs doing it, they're looking at it more from they're buying the creative minds that are making the new content all the time. So if they believe long term in content and when you look at that aggregate, you can have a couple of them slip and have a couple of heroes in there. And when you see all those together, you can bet that that thing is going to generate a ton of cash because the industry itself is built around being incredibly lean and then being profitable because they're only worth their profitability. And then they can accordion. You got a big show and all this staff and the show goes away. Boom. You bring it all the way back down because you put so many people under the show itself. So that's where the bigger vision is for them to look at. And is there an opportunity for creatives and people in the space in this day? Yes, because Endeavor is doing it. Churning is doing it. A lot of people are doing it, but it's extraordinarily difficult. And the gatekeepers are the distributors, the Netflix, the Paramounts. You can attempt to create your own platform and distribute it yourself, YouTube, digitally, whatever it is. But it's expensive and difficult to build audiences. And then you're really looking at those distributors as the gatekeepers to the quality of the asset that you're creating and whether or not someone will make it decide that you're worth the purchase. All of that credibly difficult, in my opinion, to make happen. 

Shaan Puri (1:21:47-1:21:48): Perfect answer. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:21:48-1:21:48): Exactly. 

Shaan Puri (1:21:48-1:21:58): I was looking for Rob. This has been amazing. Better than one, somehow. Where should people follow up? Where do you want them? You want them on your pod, your Twitter email list? How can people get more Rob? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:21:59-1:22:54): Rob's just at Robdurdick across Social on A.com, and just I got billed with Rob. But really, I'm not out pitching nothing. I'm just out trying to figure it out, keep evolving. But one day I'm going to come back on with my software. When it's done. Well, first I'm going to send it to you guys first. And then when the book and the philosophy are out and the software is out, then it's going to be like, how do we convert the listeners into changing their lives from being erratic into harmonious, high quality existences with the existing operating system? But that's off in the future. Now, I'm just glad to reconnect because I'm thankful for you guys, for kind of starting the spark of the whole thing. And really, I'm even thankful for you posting all the data and using the customer acquisition from the stuff that I sent you. I sent you all the new stuff. 

Shaan Puri (1:22:55-1:23:51): Do you know what happened, Sam? Man, I know. So basically, he came on, he did the rhythm of existence. He sent us the sale PDF we post on Twitter, and it was kind of over. And then, like a year later, I was like, all right, I'm going to start building my email list. And I was like, how do I get fans of the show, the like minded people? How do I get my type of people to subscribe? I don't just want any subscriber. I want the right type of person. I was like, what would the right type of person be into it? I was like, oh, dude, the rob deer dick. That rhythm of existence sheet, the time tracker. I think they would be nerding out about that. That's my type of nerd. And so we put it up as a lead magnet, which was like, hey, come put your email in. And he'll share his thing with you. And we start spending a bunch of money. Rob emails me like, I don't know, six months ago. He's like, Bro, you're blowing me up with this sheet? It's all good, but you got to update the photo. You're using the wrong photo from over here. And so we update the photo, and I was like, oh, man, I feel bad. We take the whole ad down. We start putting something else up. But it was a moment of embarrassment. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:23:51-1:24:03): Don't feel bad, because to me, just perpetuates. For me, it just continues to push the narrative of level of discipline and commit and data driven. 

Sam Parr (1:24:05-1:24:07): You said you subscribed it was good. 

Shaan Puri (1:24:07-1:24:18): In that we were preaching your gospel and makes you look like a badass. So there's nothing bad there. I just should have asked you first, and I forgotten to do that. I didn't do that. And that's why I felt embarrassed. I was like, oh, my bad. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:24:18-1:24:32): Yeah, I appreciate it and thought it was funny, but I was also like, this is great. Then I was interested in the data from your perspective of like, okay, well, I wonder how many it converted just to kind of understand how many well. 

Shaan Puri (1:24:32-1:24:34): There was nothing to convert to, right? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:24:34-1:24:41): Since you had the DocuSign. It was just the views of the PDF was like, what I was interested in. 

Shaan Puri (1:24:41-1:24:47): I don't think it ran for too long. I think it had maybe 50, 00, 10,000 hits, something like that. So a good amount for sure. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:24:47-1:25:02): But I'm not I love that as just another data point from my perspective. That's why I was like, hey, use the new stuff. Make it feel more inviting. Make it feel more exciting for people to see, because I want to continually to perpetuate it. 

Sam Parr (1:25:02-1:25:08): But again, Rob's getting triggered now, by the way. This is him working on that trigger of not getting angry. 

Shaan Puri (1:25:08-1:25:26): I was talking to somebody yesterday about triggers. They were like they're like, man, he just pushes my buttons. And I was like, Dude, you're like a BlackBerry. You're just covered in buttons. I was like, the problem is not that he pushed a button. You got so many buttons to push. Like, you want to be an iPhone. No buttons, nothing to push. What can someone do to you now? You're on stop, right? 

Rob Dyrdek (1:25:26-1:25:28): And it's possible for everybody to get there. 

Sam Parr (1:25:28-1:25:38): Awesome. Well, we appreciate this, dude. Last time, maybe video and audio had, like, half a million views. I have a feeling this is going to crush it. So we appreciate you. 

Rob Dyrdek (1:25:38-1:25:55): Okay. Till we meet again. Till we meet again. See you guys. Thank you. I feel like I can rule the world. I know I could be what I want to I put my all in it like no days off on the road. Let's travel never looking back.
