Alex Hormozi (0:00:00-0:00:40): Like, everybody here, we can all consume whatever we want so we can fly on whatever planes we want. Like, you know, you can fly private. You can stay in the nicest hotels, get the nicest airbnb's, go out to dinner every single other week at the five star restaurant at the Michelin Star, and you can do that for the rest of your life, but I can't buy that skyscraper right there, and I can't buy this huge company. And so what happens is, like, the things that you want to buy change, and so you create a new deficit for the amount of wealth that you want. Again, this is just assuming you like the game. And so, like, I like the game, so I just want to keep playing it. I feel like I could rule the world. I know I could be what I want to. I put my all in. It like, days off on the road. 

Shaan Puri (0:00:41-0:01:02): Where should we start? Because you do a lot of these interviews. What's the fun version of this for you? Because I feel like if somebody actually wants to know an answer to something, it's been published. You got a book, you got a Twitter, you got 1000 YouTube videos. If you're motivated, you can go find the answer. Like, I tweeted out Alex coming on the pot. Say, what would you like to know? They're like, I'd like to know his thoughts on offers. 

Alex Hormozi (0:01:02-0:01:03): Making a sure offer. 

Shaan Puri (0:01:03-0:01:21): Yes, literally his book. And I think the book is, like, free or $0.99. So that's just a lazy question at this point. But I know whenever I do interviews, there's some version of the conversations that are more fun, or I'm like, yeah, when we talk about that stuff, it's more interesting to me, and that kind of lights me up in a different way. What is that for you? 

Alex Hormozi (0:01:21-0:02:26): Well, I'll say there's two things that I've been probably focused a lot on. One is obviously acquisition.com. And so, like, what we're doing and kind of clarifying the mission between, well, all the stuff that we're actually doing every day. And then the other side of it is just that the leads book is coming out good. And so it's tough because I'm sure you guys have had stuff that you've worked on and it's like, been on its way coming out, and all of your energy is going into writing it or building it or recording stuff about it. And then you can't talk about it because I don't want to talk about it all the time until it's, like, ready to go off. And so the six weeks beforehand is when it's like, we have all this prerecorded stuff. I've got full courses, I've got all this shit that's going to drop when the next book comes out. But I haven't talked about anything leads related for, like, two years because I've known because I've been working on it for two years. For the next launch. So those are the two things that are, like, top of mind for me, like what we're doing on the Mosymedia side and acquisition.com and then the lead stuff. 

Shaan Puri (0:02:26-0:02:49): What's the split between those two? So you got media, you got acquisitions.com. Give me the time split. So on a given month, what percent? If there's a pie chart, what are you spending on the content versus acquisitions? And then also on the money side, like, are you making more off the media or are you making more off acquisitions? What's the relative difference between the two? 

Alex Hormozi (0:02:49-0:03:36): Yeah, we lose money on media, so no, we don't make money, I think between AdSense. And if you consider book sales a part of that. But I give the book away for 99 sites. Actually, Amazon updated it because we re uploaded it with some fixits, and they wouldn't let us go below 190, which now makes all the times I said $0.99. Like, people be like, he's trying to get us. It sucks anyways. But no, I think the book does about a million bucks a year in profit in terms of what it makes. And then AdSense is probably like 500 grand a year. So it's like one and a half million. And that barely covers the media team. How big is the team right now? We've got ten, and then we've got vendors. 

Sam Parr (0:03:36-0:03:38): Are you enjoying it? 

Alex Hormozi (0:03:38-0:04:00): Yeah, I dig it. It's fun right now. I report once to answer your question, Sean, about time split. We do one recording day every 14 days. That's like the direct to camera stuff. And then if I do a podcast, like, I got one of my guys here, Trevor, who's reporting our side of it so that they can clip this stuff later. Are you any adults plus one dedicated day twice a month? 

Sam Parr (0:04:00-0:04:05): Are you enjoying the celebrity that comes with this, getting noticed and things like that? 

Alex Hormozi (0:04:06-0:04:33): Enjoys, probably. I feel like there's some people who love attention, and there's some people who hate attention. I'm like, right in the middle, you know what I mean? I was purposely, deliberately not public because I wanted to be rich and anonymous. And that was kind of like the mission for a long time for me. And then now that we are on there, I would say that there are pros and there are cons of increasing fame or what do you want to call it? Recognition. I think the pros outweigh the cons, but there are cons. 

Sam Parr (0:04:33-0:04:34): Like what? 

Alex Hormozi (0:04:34-0:05:08): You get weirdos, you know what I mean? We have security, you know what I mean? I can't attend any event. I can't attend an event. I can't go to somebody's small, group, meet up. It's very hard because I can't enjoy anything because I'll have a line of people or asking for advice or signatures or pictures or whatever. And again, I am grateful this shit to everybody to do that. It's a different experience. So if I'm going to go to something, I go into it knowing that's what my experience is going to be, not whatever or whoever's on stage. 

Shaan Puri (0:05:09-0:05:14): Yeah, it makes the online experience dope, but it makes the real life experience less different. 

Alex Hormozi (0:05:14-0:06:35): It's different. That's what he fundamentally just changes what the in person experience is. If I walk out. What's interesting is that I was able to, or have been able to mark how social media and the audience has grown by the number of real world interventions I had pre unit of time. And so I remember the first time I got recognized in public, and then it was once a month and it was once a week, and then it was once a day, and then it was every time I'd walk outside the door. And now it's about five times or six times. Every time I walk outside, I get recognized. And so I just imagine that that just continues to compound with time and with distribution. So it's different. But here's the pros. We get the best talent for our portfolio companies and for acquisition.com because so many people want to come here. We get them for at market rate or below because of all the learnings that they want. And the other people who are also pro players on the team, we get the best deal flow that's all proprietary. Companies that want to work specifically with us, they're not trying to exit to anyone or sell to anyone. They want to work with us deliberately to scale the company. So I continue to do it because I'm more rewarded for doing it than I am punished for doing it. But there are definitely you get weird letters and you get weird attacks and things like that. It comes with the territory and it's to be expected. And so for us, the pros outweigh the cons, but there are cons. 

Sam Parr (0:06:35-0:07:41): I remember talking to Tim Ferriss and you could just tell from the outside, but I don't know if he's mainstream famous or not, or if I'm in a bubble, but he's popular enough that he has all these people listening to him and all that stuff. But the cool thing about him was he had high profile people and people who like, a lot of people who listen to you, you're like, I'm thankful that you listen, but I don't exactly want to go hang out with you. But he would actually have a ton of listeners who would reach out to him who are like the Matthew McConaugheys of the world or some football coach or Ryan Holiday has that too, where it's like someone who's like a big deal, who you're like, oh, my God, you listened to me. That's amazing. I would be honored to go and hang out with you. And he had stories like that, and Sean and I have had that a little bit where some business person who we both admire will be like, yeah, I heard your pot on this thing. And I'm like, oh, wow, you listened to that? Has that have you crossed that threshold where you have people who you admire who are messaging you and being like, man, what you said was really cool. I have a question about X, Y, and Z. And you're like, oh, man, that's amazing. My heroes want to talk to me now? 

Alex Hormozi (0:07:42-0:08:34): Yeah. I mean, yes. I don't want to put anyone on blast, but there have been some mega, mega influencers who followed me and hit me, and they were like, Dude, this is awesome. And I'm like, well, now I think less of you because you follow my content. So big red flag there. I told Leila the biggest red flag I had with her was that she was into it. No, I'm kidding. But, yeah, like, some NFL players that I used to really look up to, like, huge lob stars and huge, huge podcasters that followed me. And, yeah, it's been cool. One of the reverse situations is when I go to see, I'm like, oh, yeah, how is so and so celebrity? And I click and it says, like, Follow back. And I'm like, oh, shit. But no, I mean, it's surreal. I'm sure you guys have had it's surreal. 

Sam Parr (0:08:34-0:08:59): Well, I grew up, like, admiring Lance Armstrong. I'm big into endurance sports. And one time I got an email and it was like, hey, just to let you know, I love the Hustle. And he signed it with Lance. And you could tell it was Lance Armstrong by his Gmail. And I was like, I don't believe this is really Lance Armstrong. If it is, here's my phone number. Call me right now. And he called me within, like, three minutes, and I was like he called. 

Alex Hormozi (0:08:59-0:09:00): He goes, Sam, what's going on? 

Sam Parr (0:09:00-0:09:46): And I was like, Lance, is this really youthful? And then I had a couple of other athletes holler at us. And I remember thinking, like, growing up playing sports, I would have killed to have athlete like this recognize me. And I could never achieve the athletic greatness enough for them to acknowledge my talents. And then now you just take this total outside path and you get to it. Or like, one time we had like, this was really weird, but the lead singer of Lincoln Park, Mike, he tweeted out that he likes our pod and the Hustle, whatever, and I was like, oh, that'sick I would have wanted to have met you, but there's no way I could have gone down this normal path. But if we went this weird way, we finally kind of met. And I found that to be very strange and awesome. 

Shaan Puri (0:09:46-0:09:58): Yeah, it's sort of that be so good they can't ignore you as a general advice for life. Whatever you want is on the other side of you being so good that you can't be ignored at anything. 

Alex Hormozi (0:09:59-0:10:00): At anything. 

Shaan Puri (0:10:00-0:10:39): And also, I think that's kind of what you're saying, Sam, it doesn't have to be the thing you expect, right? Like, oh, you want to meet Warren Buffett someday. You don't have to be a stock picker. That's probably actually the least likely way that Warren Buffett is going to want to know you. And in general, you shouldn't really pick based on what they want. You should just pick based on the thing you can actually get so good at that you can't be ignored. And it's hard to do. Obviously, that's hard to do, but it's more of the right guidance than many other bits of advice you could take as far as, like, a North Star for what you're going to go for, right? 

Alex Hormozi (0:10:39-0:10:40): Exactly. 

Sam Parr (0:10:40-0:11:07): And so anyway, it's cool that we're all kind of like seeing that in reality come true. Are you enjoying acquisitions.com? Because I know when we first talked to you, I think you are maybe only a year or two years in. You're relatively new. I think you had just sold Jim Launch. Are you happy with is it what you thought it was going to be? And do you actually like doing it? And by the way, explain what acquisitions what that is? 

Alex Hormozi (0:11:07-0:12:25): Yeah, so it's acquisition.com. The reason I emphasize that is because there's somebody who bought acquisitions, plural.com, and it's just not me. It's a different company. But acquisition.com is our portfolio of companies. So I'll give the TLDR in 92nd. So I had a chain of GMs, took that, licensed the IP to 5000 locations, started a supplement company, sell through that distribution base, and then started a software company. We exited all three of those companies in 2021. We taken about 40 million in distributions prior to the exit, and we sold for 46.2 million. And the software company I did separately or sold separately in a strategic deal that was all stock. And I said that because you guys probably laugh, because people are like, I Googled Altrumo's net worth, and it says 15 million. It's like, well, I sold the company for 46 and all cash. So, like, I don't know where you got that. And the only reason you do that and get that money is because it was making money. Anyways, that was pretty much 2021. So we closed December 25 or 6th, I can't remember. It was it was one of those days. It was right around Christmas 24th, christmas Eve. That's towards Christmas Eve we is we closed. And then we started acquisition the next day. And so that was when we, like, we made our kind of declaration. At that point, though, I'd already made three minority investments that had done really, really well, and that's why I wanted to make that kind of my next big thing. 

Shaan Puri (0:12:25-0:12:45): If you started it the next day, that means you kind of had this idea cooking. So what was the genesis? What made you realize, oh, this is what I should do next. I should buy these minority stakes in companies like the one that I just built, and I should get this domain name, which I assume you had to buy. So how were you so ready to do that? What was the thought process? 

Alex Hormozi (0:12:45-0:15:17): So during COVID obviously, gyms were affected by COVID. We took a hit. We took a major hit. We were so profitable. But it was a big it was hard. And so to kind of get some space because there wasn't a lot, like, I couldn't do more. Obviously, we pushed things harder, but I was above the business enough that there was nothing I wasn't going to do anything right? And so I kind of just needed to take my mind off things. And so, by happenstance, a guy who owned a photography a single photography studio made his movie on my calendar. And this is not how you do this. Everyone like, do not do this. But I was actually still taking some calls for Alan because I wanted to do some testing. And this was before I had a big brand. So I was just kind of like, founder, talking to customers to get an idea of what was going on. But he knew me enough from just like I had written a small book in the gym space called Gym Launch Secrets that he had read that book, loved it, applied it to his photography business, and he took a sales call through my software company because he knew I was taking the calls. And so he hopped on and was like, I have no interest in your software. He's like, but can you please give you 20 minutes? And I was like, sure, man. All right. And I just liked his vibe. And so anyways, we ended up doing a deal. And so we took a minority percentage of the business. And that business, I think, had done they were doing 1.6 million a year at a single location, which was pretty awesome for a tiny, like, photography studio. And I think he had taken and this isn't all the book, clearly, because there's a million things, but he had taken some of the concepts from Jimmy Shaker's book, applied them, and it had grown the business a lot. And he had an agency for photographers to kind of, like, do the same model for them, right? And so we were having a conversation, and he was like, yeah, I did exactly what you said. And all the photographer studios add 400,000 a year to top line when they use our thing. I was like, they add 400,000 a year? He's like, yeah, on average. And I was like, okay, how much are we selling this thing for? And he's like, pennies. And I was like, okay, so let's not do that and let's own them all. And this is where the trust factor of what the inbound deal flow, which is what I love about acquisition.com, is that we have a lot of trust. And so he actually shut down a business that was making him, I think, 500,000 a year in profit that agency side and shut it down to zero because he believed that he believed me enough to go all in on this other direction of private ownership of all the locations. 

Sam Parr (0:15:17-0:16:03): Do you ever wake up in the morning and dread the day or struggle with feelings of discontent? We all have. That's why I'm excited to share with you a new podcast called Practical Stoicism. Every Saturday morning, host Tanner Campbell examines the ancient texts of stoicism and delivers practical takeaways that you can use to find a more fulfilling life. Stoicism has been practiced by kings, presidents, entrepreneurs, and more. But don't be intimidated. You can benefit and learn from the principles of stoicism, just like George Washington and Adam Smith did. We highly recommend checking out Tanner's episodes with Centara Gonzalez about wisdom unlocked a stoicism based program that helps inmates transition to a stable life outside of jail. So if you're interested, you can check out Practical Stoicism on Apple, Spotify, or wherever else you get your podcasts. 

Alex Hormozi (0:16:03-0:16:18): And so as of today and that was 2020 as of today, we have 36 locations in that business, just 30 plus million a year, and it continues to grow by one or two locations every month. 

Sam Parr (0:16:18-0:16:20): What's that business do? 

Alex Hormozi (0:16:20-0:16:23): Enchanted fairies. So it's children's photography, right? 

Sam Parr (0:16:23-0:16:24): Dude, that's insane. 

Shaan Puri (0:16:26-0:16:30): When we last had you on, I saw I went to the website, and I was like, okay, cool. What are the acquisitions? 

Alex Hormozi (0:16:30-0:16:31): Great. 

Shaan Puri (0:16:31-0:16:35): What did they acquire? And I saw basically like, enchanted fairies. 

Alex Hormozi (0:16:35-0:16:36): And I was like, okay, cool. 

Shaan Puri (0:16:36-0:16:58): They're doing, like, the gym launch playbook on this other space. That makes a lot of sense. And if I go there today, they're still those same companies. So how come you're not putting new acquisitions up there? I assume you've made a bunch of acquisitions, like, in the last 24 months or whatever. Why not put new companies up there? You're pretty open about other stuff, but in this case, you're not putting them up there. And then also let's start with that. 

Alex Hormozi (0:16:59-0:18:37): Yeah. Main reason. So there's two big reasons why we're not public about the acquisitions. Number one is that my brand has grown to such a degree that if I say, hey, this business is awesome, and it has a national ability, chain of ferries is less of an unless you're in one of those 30 markets. And also, my audience isn't like moms with kids. So it's arm's length enough that it doesn't affect the business. But as you can imagine, a lot of the businesses come to me are business services, and they're national, they're international, whatever companies. And so, like me endorsing a company would 510 X the company overnight. And so that comes with a couple of things. One is that I haven't negotiated those deals with a brand endorsement included. If I include a brand endorsement, then I own majority. I'm not going to risk my face on something I can't control. And so these are most of the most of the investments we have are minority. We do have a majority investment as well. But that was one that came in as a minority and then I just bought more because I love the business and it was up our wheelhouse. The second thing is that if we were to exit those businesses and I had done an endorsement in a minority position, then guess who has to go with the deal? Me. Right. As an acquirer, if there's some massive influencer that's associated with the brand, he's not getting out in a deal. And so our whole goal is to build value in the business so that the business is sellable and more valuable. And we use my face to bring deals in. And so that's why I've been really tight lipped about the businesses. 

Sam Parr (0:18:38-0:18:40): How many deals have you done so far? 

Alex Hormozi (0:18:40-0:18:48): Right now we have eleven portfolio companies. Is it all your own money or you raised a fund? No, it's all private. It's all mine. Damn, dude. 

Sam Parr (0:18:48-0:18:56): So you're going all in on this. And so I asked you originally, are you happy with how this is working out? Is it what you thought it was? 

Shaan Puri (0:18:56-0:18:56): What's he going to say? 

Alex Hormozi (0:18:56-0:18:57): No. 

Sam Parr (0:18:58-0:19:06): Yeah, I could be like, well he's like, well, I didn't realize this is actually just mostly a due diligence game and I don't know if I'd love that. 

Shaan Puri (0:19:06-0:19:11): What's the worst part about it? What's something you didn't kind of what's the downside you didn't fully respect up front? 

Alex Hormozi (0:19:11-0:19:51): So I think there's like knowing something and then experiencing it are two kind of separate things. And so like, I know that in a minority position we have to use soft influence to try and move things forward. I know that. But I would say the most difficult part is half listened to advice. And so I'll give you an example. So if I say, hey, we think that this operator in your business blows and we need a new operator, person says, okay, and then we find them a new operator, and then they hire the new operator, but then they don't fire the old operator. Like what the fuck? 

Shaan Puri (0:19:51-0:19:52): Right? 

Alex Hormozi (0:19:52-0:20:58): Very hard to win at that point. Right? So it's kind of like listening to half of someone's diet advice. It's like, yeah, I'm doing the cheat days, rushing the cheat days. It's like, yeah, but there's other days that you're in a deficit. Yeah, but you said cheat days raise your metabolism. Yeah, but you also need a deficit, you know what I mean? And so it's listening and completeness. And so I don't know, we may move to because the business that I would say transparently that I enjoy the most is the one that we have complete control. And so we bought majority of that business and we were growing that one like gangbusters. And the speed to action is so much faster. That being said, I would say the biggest wins we have been able Company that came to us at 16 million the year before did 50 last year. 20 million in EBITDA. That's the biggest company that we have. The portfolio we've had the enchanted various is obviously one that two ish with combining the two things. They're pacing two and a half million a month right now or 2.7, something like that. So we have a pretty ridiculous deal, right? 

Shaan Puri (0:20:58-0:21:28): Like, I had a friend message me that was like, dude, Harmosi's playbook is obviously amazing, but he's like, this deal that they offered us. He's like, I don't know who would take this. And I don't know if this is actually the deal or not, but he's like, basically, it was like, no money. We'll give you no money, but we get ownership if we grow it above X. So it's kind of like, I think sounded like more of a risk free strategy in a way. But is there a standard deal structure? 

Sam Parr (0:21:28-0:21:29): And is that it? 

Shaan Puri (0:21:29-0:21:38): Where you're not putting capital in, you're basically saying, give us the equity. We guarantee we grow by this much. And if we don't, some claw back. 

Alex Hormozi (0:21:38-0:21:44): We've iterated it honestly a bunch of times. This is to answer your question, Sam, like, probably even more poignantly now that. 

Sam Parr (0:21:44-0:21:44): We'Re getting into it. 

Alex Hormozi (0:21:45-0:24:55): One of the hardest things about the investment cycle is that when you're making a product or you're trying to sell a service, you can ideate it, create an MVP pitch. It see how it goes within like, 60 days. The whole thing. Souped to nuts. You can do that whole cycle. 60 days for deals. It's like you can think of an idea for a deal structure. It takes 90 days to six months to close the deal, and then it might take a year to see even just, like, some preliminaries of, like, how do we like this structure? How does it work, et cetera. And so I still feel like we are most in our infancy in the deal structures that we have. So, like, in terms of no money in, there are deals we put money in. There are deals that we don't put money in. It depends on the deal. The big one for money is. It depends on what the need of the business is. So, like, if we're opening up a lot of Brick and Mortar locations like we're about To, I Think We might have Actually closed today or tomorrow on a 28 location Chain. That one requires capital to open more locations. So that one I'm like. I know where the capital is going. I see what their turns on capital are. Let's get that right. If it's a national based service business. So let's say it's mortgage sales. There's no capex. They just need recruiting. They need the guys. That's how sales gets increased. And so that's the money. Where's The Money going and what is it used for? What I don't want to do is just like, someone got to go buys a mansion after I write a check. That's not the goal here. The goal is that we're both together wanting to grow this massive thing. And so it just really depends on what the nature of the deal is. So that's number one in terms of how we structure them. Originally, I had a grand slam offer type thing. Now it's just much more straightforward of, like, we're equity holders in the business. It's interesting because it's actually gotten less cute and less clever as time has gone on. It's just much more like, this is our deal. We own a big chunk of the business, and we're going to grow it. And, I mean, the thing is that for us, based on my holdco costs, I put 500,000 a year in labor into the businesses. And that's if I wanted to not mark up labor, that's hard cost. And so if a company, for example, is doing, whatever, 5 million a year in EBITDA, and I'm buying a one third stake or a 40% stake in the business, what are my value? That and how much of that value is going to come in the form of just work that we're going to do? And so that's where the valuation and how much cash in, et cetera, kind of becomes more like per deal basis. But yeah. So the long story short is one is soft influence has been something that I've been learning. We may, in the future, just do more majority deals where the founder stays on, because what I want to do is show how much more we grew this. I mean, we do have, obviously, some minority ones that have crushed too, but I want to murder this maturity deal and be like, wouldn't you like to have 49% of something ten times bigger or 100 times bigger? And so that's kind of the angle. But yeah, we're learning every day. 

Sam Parr (0:24:56-0:25:23): We talked to our good friend is Andrew Wilkinson. He's done a similarish thing as you. And then we've had a handful of other friends that have done something, and they're like, well, I got really inspired when I read the Swarm Buffett book, and that taught me a little bit about compounding growth. And other people have cited other books or things that they learned where they're like, oh, no, this is the way to go. And that's why I got into this. What about you? What transitioned you from going to this almost PE model versus just one brand model? 

Alex Hormozi (0:25:24-0:30:19): Yeah, definitely. If I were to give us a name, it would be like a merger of a family office and a conglomerate, because family office, in that it's literally just family money. Like, I don't I don't have any outside investors. And then conglomerate in terms of, like, our business model, like, I'm not trying to exit anything. I would. Like to continue to compound the investments we have. If a founder absolutely needs to or wants to, or gets divorced and has to create the asset, then we will go down that route. But long term, we're long term holders. But in terms of the inspiration, it was actually because Gym Launch has there's only 50,000 micro gyms, like in the US. At least. And we had already gotten on the phone with 20,000. So, like, if you're a microgemonar, know who we are, probably. And I realized I went to this, this little meetup of entrepreneurs and it was like six or seven people and the whole room was doing in aggregate, like 500 million a year in revenue. And I think we were doing like mid thirty s at the time. And I was really excited to go because I was like, what do these guys have that I don't have? What am I missing? Right? And we had been there for like three years, we'd been in mid 30s for three years. And I felt like I was like something was wrong. And the big takeaway I had was not that they had better systems or they're better at marketing or better at sales or better at product. They just were going after a bit of market. Like every single one of them to a man had a market that was ten to 100 times the size of. And so I said that whatever I wanted to do next was going to be was going to go after a much bigger market and there are significantly more businesses than there are gyms. And so that was kind of the big thing is like, okay, well, it's something that can compound forever and that has a huge tam. And so we kind of walked backwards from there. And then in terms of the doing this model, we believe that people build the people and the people build the business. And so it was like 18 months of ideation. I know we're going full circle, but how did we start the next day? Well, these were the things that we were thinking through. And I said, Leila, if I were to die tomorrow, what business would you start? She was like, I would start a recruiting firm. I was like, I don't want to start a recruiting firm. I was like, is there a way that we could combine what you like and what I like into something cool? And so for us, the most hands on valuable thing that you can do for a business is find a players. Because if you find a players, you put them in the business, then they grow the business and then that value stays inside the enterprise of the business. Not holdco like not the goose but the egg, right? And so for us, we just recreate crazy talent because our competitive mode is that we have more influence than they do. And so we have a whole culture community of MOSY talent where our head of people continues to bring. We have tons of people every single day that are applying for portfolio positions, and then we can screen them, vet them, and then because we know the company and because we're long term incentivize, we don't just want to put a body in a seed. We want to find a killer that we know that if we only want to fill the role once, right, we want to fill it with somebody who matches the culture and matches the skill set of the business at this level. So a lot of times, like, first time entrepreneurs, they're at whatever, a million months, and they're like, okay, do I hire a bookkeeper? Do I hire a staff accountant? Do I hire a controller? Do I hire a CFO? Do I hire a director of finance? Who am I hiring right now, and what does that person look like? And so we've done this enough times to be like, okay, at this level, you probably need a controller who has experience going from a million a month to 3 million a month at that point. And we'll tell them upfront that we will bring a CFO who has transaction experience in the future. So they're not jostled when that happens, right? Same thing. They're scaling out the sales team. They're like, okay, well, I've got three good guys. It's like, cool, we need 20. So you can't just take your best closer and make him manager because he's never done this before. So we want somebody who's built at least one or two sales teams specific to, let's say it's inbound or might be outbound, depends on the sales process of the business. And they've built those types of teams and like, cool, we'll bring that guy in, we have our playbooks. Then we say, hey, on our interview process, we're like, this is how we do things during line with that. And if we do feel like there's alignment and they have the chops because we do skill tests, then we can say, hey, I think that you'll match. And obviously the founder still has final say because they have to like the person. The rise is going to work, but we do a lot of that heavy lifting because we might take 100 interviews at Holdco to find one guy for one specific role for one company, and that's where that labor cost comes in for us. But Willis Be put, like, the reason we took majority and it took majority, but majority of that business was we had built the entire executive team. We built the entire executive team, and we're like, okay, cool. And the fatter was like, you know what? I kind of want to do other things for the business. I know it's in good hands. I trust you guys. And so it was like, a very friendly deal. And now he just gets checks every month and likes his life a lot. And we just continue to run the business, which we're cool. 

Sam Parr (0:30:19-0:31:07): There's this really cool video where you're with Grant Cardone and I think you were like in the process or pre process for selling Gym Launch and you were like and he said something like rich people sell their companies, wealthy people never sell. And cool is that I've sold a company before. Sean has sold some companies before you've sold a company. What's so funny is a lot of first time founders and second 3rd time, a lot of people, their whole business is selling, but after they sell, they go through this period and they're like, shit, I shouldn't sell ever again, actually. And you said you sold the business for 47 million. You said you had taken 40 million in distributions. So in my head I'm like, that's a pretty shit sale then. Do you wish that you would have just held onto it and never sold that company? 

Alex Hormozi (0:31:08-0:33:59): No. Because the person I was then wouldn't be able to do what I can do now. Could I do that today? Would I hold on to it? Yes. But I don't think I could have done it then. And so a lot of the reason transparently. If I had, I got more credibility from selling Gym Launch at 46 and it was valued at 150 before COVID So to your point, it was a shit sale. But I was done. I was emotionally done with the business. I just didn't want to do it anymore. I still own a third of the business. So like when they crush the exit, the next exit at $250,000,000, they'll get my 100 million dollar check from that. But I moved on. And my big thing is like, all my friends, all my close people were like, dude, you sound depressed as far. And I was like, dude, I want to do this new thing. And they're like, dude, you light up when you talk about this new thing. And so I actually walked away from the deal during the deal process and then came back. It's funny because people give me a lot of I'm glad you brought it up because a lot of people give me praise for that. But they don't have context. We done 30 million in EBITDA the 24 months prior to the deal. So selling a 46.2 is not like I told them I needed to be public about the number because I do know that the vast majority of people don't get it. And that is enough to give me credibility for fucking TikTok. But it's not like the transaction itself isn't necessarily one that I'm like, proud of. I'm proud of what we built and that the company's grown 40% since we sold it. They're going to kill on that deal. But now that I also understand how debt works, which I didn't understand that again, this is like knowing, experiencing. I understood that they were going to get debt below and I realized that 80 or 90% of the money that they put in, they then just immediately pulled right back out, leveraging the company's books. I was like, well, shit, I could have kept the whole fucking thing and gotten 90% of the money not personally guaranteed and derisked myself. But would that have created the same story of something that is sellable from a personal brand perspective? And I think the answer is no. And so I don't regret the sale. I think the sale was required for that step in my journey. I think that now, because we have the credibility, no one cared that I taking 40 million in distributions. No one gave a shit. They didn't matter. The day I sold, my neighbors were like, oh, I saw you on Forbes. Congratulations. I was like, I was richer before I did the transaction. I was wealthier before that point. But it allowed us to do acquisition.com because I don't think I could have because my brand was still so I was still the CEO, as far as people were concerned, of that company, and I needed to have that space so that I could create acquisition. 

Sam Parr (0:33:59-0:34:02): Sean, what do you think? Would you have done that? 

Shaan Puri (0:34:02-0:34:22): I think he explained it beautifully. I think he explained it exactly beautifully and honestly, which was that two things you just said that resonate deeply with me. One, this is the last thing you just said, which is, to have what you want, sometimes you just need to make space. And so this is like I learned this through relationships. You're dating somebody, they're not exactly what you want. 

Alex Hormozi (0:34:23-0:34:23): They're not bad. 

Shaan Puri (0:34:23-0:34:34): There's nothing wrong. There's nothing terrible about it. So most people just stick with it for years and years and years, and then they're kind of like, well, if there was a much better option, then, yeah, I would feel more comfortable just. 

Alex Hormozi (0:34:34-0:34:36): Like, going being single. 

Shaan Puri (0:34:36-0:35:23): But I've always been very quick to just if I know this isn't it, I'll break up. I don't need to have another great option ready or shown to me to make it real. I know that if I make space, then great things can appear. And sometimes you just got to do that. When we sold Bibo, it was the same thing. I had been doing this thing for six or seven years, and the business was doing okay at that point. But in my heart of hearts, I knew, this is never going to be massive. And we had all gone into that business with basically like, yo, let's do something massive. So by other people's standards, it might have been a good business. By our own mission, it was going to be a failure. I knew that. And so it was when I was out with a friend, and he was like, I don't get what you're doing. And he's like, you just need to shake things up. And I was shook. 

Alex Hormozi (0:35:23-0:35:24): I couldn't sleep. 

Shaan Puri (0:35:24-0:35:52): I was like, he's right. Like, I've been doing this for too long. I need to shake things up. And so I went into our investor the next day, and I just said, I think it's time we change things up. I said, I need to change things up. I said, if you want to keep going, I will help you hire a CEO, and you can have somebody else take this over. I'll give you back my shares. I don't need a thing from this. I will do whatever I can. Or give me 30 days. I'm going to see if I can. 

Sam Parr (0:35:52-0:35:55): Sell or I'm out. 

Shaan Puri (0:35:55-0:37:15): Either way, in 30 days, this is going to change for me. I've just decided to make space, basically for something. He's like, well, what do you want to do next? And I was like, I have no idea. He's like, well, no, really? Usually people, when they come to me, it's because they already kind of lined up something else. I was like, no, honestly, I have no idea. I just know that I need to make some space. And so that part resonates with me. And also the idea of when I look back now and I'm like, oh, before I sold our company, if my company wasn't going to be the next big thing, I would just shut it down. Literally just turn it off, take a zero on it. And then I just started looking around, and I learned this word aqua hire in Silicon Valley. Oh, people just sell failing companies. And then I learned, like, the asset sale, it's like, oh, you could just sell the code and the assets. Like, Wait, who are these buyers? And I didn't even really understand what my options were. And so when you talk about basically, I could have refinanced, I could have just refinanced based on the business assets. Took 90% of the value. I felt that same stupidity later. But that's life. Life is basically looking back and being like, I was such an idiot. And that's how I mark years of time. Not by the calendar days, but by a number of times. I look back and say, god, I was so dumb. I didn't even understand this. I was sitting on something. I didn't really know what I should now, knowing what I know now, I know exactly what I should have done. And at that time, I wasn't even aware that I was making a mistake. 

Sam Parr (0:37:15-0:37:40): Well, the difference is I think that us three actually have done. We are tacticians. So I understand how to grow shit. And I understand, like, you build this page, you do this thing, you write these words, here's the customer, you talk to them, whatever. I think the gap you have to bridge is becoming from tactics to strategy. And I used to make fun of all my buddies who are in finance. I'm like, Dude, you're just like an excel monkey. 

Alex Hormozi (0:37:40-0:37:41): You don't know anything. 

Sam Parr (0:37:41-0:38:39): You're just this stupid fucking hedge fund and maybe it makes money, but you don't know shit. And then I realized when they talk about debt and stuff, I was like, I'm not going to pay attention to any of that because I think that's stupid. And then I realized how it starts working and I'm like, oh my God, that's strategy. So it's like, that's the strategy. And I was like, oh, I've got good vision. I understand how this shit works. And then I realized how money worked a little bit more with debt and borrowing other people's money to do this and taking money off the table and all these terms that I kind of heard about but I didn't exactly understand. I realized, shit, if I'm going to be really good at my job, I got to understand the tactics. You really also have to understand the strategy, which Alex, it seems like you're actually now you get the strategy of how money and business works, not just the tactics, which the whole 100 million dollar offer book, which I read. I think it's awesome. That's mostly tactical, but the strategic shit is what you're saying of like, oh, you can borrow other people's money and to do this. That's some big picture shit. 

Alex Hormozi (0:38:39-0:39:51): Yeah. Without a personal guarantee. Because I'll be like, why don't we debt on the business? Because I don't want to risk that. It's like you are not risking it like the business is risking in it. And if you're willing to do a sale for X, it's like, well are you willing to do because the business is going to take the risk on either way. I mean, depending on the acquirer. But if you're selling a private equity, I know you have a lot of a bigger tech audience, but I probably have a bigger, I would say everyday business audience. Guys who have massive roofing businesses or a huge chain of teeth whitening studios. Those types of businesses are the ones that tend to follow more of my stuff. And that's usually going to be a roll up or a private equity acquirer for the most part, right. Maybe a strategic if you have another big teeth whitening chain that wants to buy you. But that's about it. And I resonate with what you said, Sam. I always thought those guys, I was like, you don't even understand business. And I to a degree, I actually don't think they understand business, but they understand the macro level of business. And I think where you get really dangerous is when you know both, they both games because what they do is they do almost purely inorganic growth. They try and staple shit together. That okay. We bought four companies that do 3 million in EBITDA. And so now we have 12 million EBITDA and we're going to have some equity arbitrage and we're going to be able to sell this thing. 

Shaan Puri (0:39:51-0:39:52): Financial engineering. 

Alex Hormozi (0:39:52-0:40:23): Yeah, saddle them up with debt and then it's just a math equation. Like, it doesn't even matter about growing the businesses, but it's like, what if do that? And you could also triple all the businesses. And it's like that's when you create these breathtaking home runs. And that's kind of what we're trying to do with acquisition. And I don't have a huge need for more money unless it's an enormous there's nothing I can do. Have you ever heard Felix Dennis's how to be rich? I think that's the name of the book. 

Shaan Puri (0:40:24-0:40:32): We talk about that table a lot. Like the comfortably poor, comfortably rich. Then you get to, like, rich, rich, super resonated. 

Alex Hormozi (0:40:32-0:41:14): With me, it's like I'm the comfortably rich, not the super rich. Everybody here, we can all consume whatever we want, so we can fly on whatever planes we want. You can fly private. You can stay in the nicest hotels, get the nicest airbnbs, go out to dinner every single night of the week at the five star restaurant at the Michelin Star, and you can do that for the rest of your life. Your personal needs as a human being are satisfied, but I can't buy that skyscraper right there, and I can't buy this huge company. And so what happens is, like, the things that you want to buy change, and so you create a new deficit for the amount of wealth that you want. Again, this is just assuming you like the game. And so, like, I like the game, and so I just want to keep playing it. 

Shaan Puri (0:41:15-0:42:12): The funny thing is that what you actually like is just playing the game. And if you just said, Well, I'm rich enough, then you'd have to stop playing the game you really love. And so instead, you start to come up with things you want that in actuality sound a little bit silly. It's like, actually, I don't even think you want that skyscraper or to buy that. I don't even think that's actually what motivates you. It's just that I'm actually peak loving the game right now. And the game only works if you care about the score. And so it is impossible to enjoy that. You can't play the game. If you've said, I've already scored the maximum number of points, then the game becomes kind of silly. And so it's funny, like, this is with all of our friends. It's like, well, why are you doing this? You kind of got enough money, man. And it's like, yeah, but I don't have enough enjoyment. The enjoyment game is infinite. And the thing I enjoy the most is playing this game. So I'm going to continue playing, but in order to do so, I have to construct these silly dreams that I'm not even sure I really care as much about as far as just playing the game. 

Alex Hormozi (0:42:12-0:46:39): Dude, that was huge. And as a side note, if you think there's kind of, like, I feel like two ways you can create a deficit, right? So one is like, you can create a financial deficit by saying, I want this thing. It costs a billion dollars, and so I need to go make a billion dollars. There's my deficit between where I am, where I want to go. The other side is what I was saying. When you ask, what are you excited it about? Because I know you said, what are the worst parts? But I'll tell you what's good right now is that we have finally separated MOSY Media, which is basically like my Layla's personal brand. And the content we put out, I would say the books kind of fall under that. Like the courses, the books, all the materials we give out to Mozimedia. And so what we originally were saying when we started acquisition.com is that the mission was to make real business knowledge accessible to everyone. That was the mission of the company. And that is still very much the mission of Mozimedia. What we realized is that holdco's team, so, like, our ex consultants are people who recruit talent, our heads of sales, who built out sales teams, our heads of marketing who built out marketing departments and marketing functions, our head of customer success, who builds out product in the client experience, et cetera. Those people didn't really resonate with making business education accessible to everyone. That wasn't actually what their mission was. And so we got really clear on what the mission of acquisition.com is, which is and this kind of came organically. So it's like, really exciting for me. But one of the things I've always envied about Elon is that every company he gets involved in basically saves the world. He finds a way to tie the mission of what he's doing to saving the world. Even Twitter, he was like, Free civilization needs free speech. And it's like, boom. I was like, man, how did he take a meme platform with tweets of arrogant dudes and turn it into free speech for civilization? That's where I think a lot of his genius is. And so for us, I was like, what's that thing? And so we have the external gap of like, yeah, I want to hit the billion or whatever, but I think the internal one is that we want to build a company off of praise and not punishment. And so we have this huge things. How we try to build things is like, you can punish people or you can praise them. And we believe that you get more performance out of praise. Now. You look at Goldman Sachs, you look at JP morgan, you look at McKinsey, you look at Bain, you look at these massive companies, even some of these huge ones, and a lot of people are like, man, it's a toxic work environment. It's really hard, blah, blah, blah. And so those are usually punishment driven cultures. What's happened is, by doing that, that has aligned all of our holdco team in terms of how we want to build these companies. And the billion dollar Alex mark is basically irrelevant because to really win by their standards, we need to build something that's ten or 50 or 100 billion, you know what I mean? And that might take the rest of my lifetime and it'll probably happen after I die. But if we can do that, then we can prove one thesis, which is like, people want to work, and most environments are set up to put people and all you do is you raise the bar of what it takes to not get punished. But what happens is people churn out of work, they burn out, they hate their jobs, they hate their lives. And I think that there's a better way. And Leila and I are going to try and dedicate the rest of our lives to trying to prove that. And so that is the mission of acquisition.com and what we do with the companies. And we can show that that it's not just like fluffy stuff. And I think if it were just Layla, it'd be a woman driven thing. People like, oh, it's a girl who's saying you should be nice to people. But I think I given how I look, how I talk, I can probably deliver that message and it may take the rest of my life to do it, but I haven't felt fucking amped about anything in a long time. The last time I was this pumped was when the mission of Gym launch was to take the gym industry from his knees to its feet. Because the average gym owner takes down $36,000 a year in personal income and has, like, maxed out credit cards and has like, 18 days of cash on hand. And I was like, I want to fix this. And what ended up happening is because I wasn't emotionally mature enough. I took enough licks from people really close to me, both clients and employees, that I just like I just needed to put distance. Like, I had 17 different people who worked for me try to start their version of my business, you know what I mean? I had clients try and start their because it was a business based on consulting. It was a consulting business. So once you had kind of the models, you could, in theory trying to be with us. Now no one has succeed. But it was enough that I was like, dude, you were bankrupt, on the brink of divorce and used all this stuff, and then you scaled to three locations and sold them, and now your family's financially set off and like, now you want to attack me. It happened times to your feet and then you kicked me. 

Shaan Puri (0:46:40-0:46:41): This is how I get repaid for this. 

Alex Hormozi (0:46:42-0:47:12): That's how it felt. That's how it felt. And so I wasn't I think now I can handle it a lot better. But at the time, I felt so disenfranchised. I just felt hurt, honestly, because I really poured my soul into trying to fix the gym industry. And so when I felt that way, we created space, and then it just became an asset we owned, and that's why I was open to selling it. But I haven't felt like that until now. And maybe it took two or three years for me to refine what that big mission was, but that's something I can get behind. Like, that's something I'm fucking amped for. 

Shaan Puri (0:47:12-0:47:50): It's so funny. You mentioned the Elon big mission thing. Like, this guy, he did it with Twitter too, which was really funny. And then while he was doing that deal, news came out. It's like oh, elon musk impregnates. Like this woman who worked for him, and he's like, overpopulation, underpopulation. We were at risk of population collapse. It's actually the biggest risk of all. And he's like, I'm just doing my part. And I was like, this guy. Teflon, don. How did he get away with it? He spun that shit. He did his whole, like, 540 on that thing, spitting that to be like, actually, I was also saving the planet with that one, too. 

Alex Hormozi (0:47:53-0:47:54): You're welcome. 

Shaan Puri (0:47:55-0:48:08): What's that thing they call it where it's just like the male bullshit the abilities for some men to just absolutely bullshit their way out of everything. And Elon's got that. He is the world leader in that. 

Alex Hormozi (0:48:08-0:48:26): I think there's a minute, though, because even thinking if I wanted to create a stronger narrative because I'm already amped about this narrative, but I would just look up stats on worker involvement and talk about how it's the end of work unless something changes. And so it's like we're saving work. Yeah, it's all what story you're telling. 

Shaan Puri (0:48:26-0:48:41): Yourself, because then you'll tell that story to others, and if that story serves you, then great. I mean, I personally, I think this is the Silicon Valley, like PTSD or whatever, where it's like anytime I hear a mission statement, I'm like, just shut the fuck up. 

Alex Hormozi (0:48:41-0:48:42): Tell the truth. 

Shaan Puri (0:48:42-0:48:43): You want to make money? 

Alex Hormozi (0:48:43-0:48:44): Great. 

Shaan Puri (0:48:44-0:50:05): You want your own life value to increase. And you realize that in order for you to get that value, you had to create more value in the world. And so you identified some people that needed something, and you provided that value in spades. Whether that was dentists need better software, or that the world needs a social network, or we want to send disappearing photos back and forth to each other's phones. You hear Evan Spiegel, you go look at the original landing page of Snapchat or the emails that he sent to the Sororities and Fraternities, where he's just like the landing page is like two chicks in a white bikini, kind of like taking like a naughty selfie, basically. And then there's a giant timer where the photo is going to disappear. And same thing when he's emailing the frats. And sororities telling me he's not saying, I'm trying to reinvent the way that. Humans communicate. Actually, 75% of our brains is wired for images, not text. And so I wanted to make a messaging app that was image based. And then you hear him do the pitch, and he's like, for too long, images have only been used for memories, but I wanted to use images for communication the way we originally did with Hieroglyphics and shit. It's like, Bro, it's okay that you thought this app was fun and cool and that it might be a hit. And it took off in these schools because people wanted to get around their teachers or parents being able to see. 

Alex Hormozi (0:50:05-0:50:06): Photos in their camera roll. 

Shaan Puri (0:50:06-0:50:10): That's okay. But they always do this. They always tie it back to something. 

Sam Parr (0:50:10-0:50:16): Now the word is a mission. Now. It's the D word. It's Democratized. We want Democratize. 

Shaan Puri (0:50:17-0:50:19): Access to private limos. 

Alex Hormozi (0:50:19-0:50:20): Really? 

Shaan Puri (0:50:20-0:50:33): And then, of course, what does it become, right? As the marketing teams get in there and the consultants get in there, they're like, our mission at Uber is to make transportation as readily available as running water. That became their mission statement. 

Sam Parr (0:50:33-0:50:35): It sounds fucking yeah, but at first. 

Alex Hormozi (0:50:35-0:50:36): It was amazing, but I want to. 

Sam Parr (0:50:36-0:50:41): Be really by showing up in a black limo, and literally the early stories. 

Shaan Puri (0:50:41-0:50:53): Of anybody who knew Travis and Garrett at Uber was like they would be like, Dude, check this out. Push a button while they're at their Michelin Star dinner and be like, Watch. This car shows up. And they're like, yeah, that's right. 

Alex Hormozi (0:50:53-0:50:53): Baller rent. 

Shaan Puri (0:50:53-0:51:26): I could see where he's at on the map. Like this is amazing. This is my private driver. I summon him through my app, and it's like, there's always, to me, like, the disconnect between what I think the truth is, which is a little bit skeptical and jaded, and then the revisionist history story that sounds really admirable and noble. And I personally have just come down, and I've landed on, like, I'm okay with the truth. I get the human nature. We're kind of just primal animals, and it's okay. You seek pleasure. You avoid pain. You like status, and you don't want to. Status. 

Sam Parr (0:51:27-0:51:53): Alex's. Alex. Maybe it started. The mission of our company is to get your money and to put it in our bank account. We're changing our bank account, $1 at a time. And we're starting with your dollar by making it our dollar. Have you heard South Park, where Cartman has crack baby basketball league? 

Alex Hormozi (0:51:53-0:51:54): And he's like, no. 

Sam Parr (0:51:54-0:52:02): Someone's like, look, we need to pay our babies, our athletes more money. He goes, look, ma'am, I don't make up the rules. I just think them up and write them down. 

Alex Hormozi (0:52:02-0:52:03): Like, what do you want me to do? 

Sam Parr (0:52:05-0:52:19): Because inevitably, I imagine it started with, I just want to get rich and do dope shit. And then it changed to this pretty grand thing of changing work instead of using praise. When did that change? 

Alex Hormozi (0:52:19-0:54:16): I think it's a yes. And so Sean, I'm like the bullshit ometer et cetera. I fullheartedly hear you on that. And I think that one is that the truth can change. And what I mean by that is because we're not talking about a fact, we're talking about truth of why someone does something. And so why someone does something can change. So when I started Gym Launch, I've said this the mission of Gym Launch was to not be broke. That was the mission of gym launch. But what happened is after I saw the lives that got transformed from it and I was no longer broke, the mission had to change because I had accomplished that mission. So the mission had to get bigger in order to continue to expand. That because I had families who relied on me, employees, et cetera, customers. And so it did truly become to take its knees from its east to its gym industry, from its niece to his feet. Right? And so acquisition.com started with the thing that I was passionate about because the only thing I was passionate about was just spreading good business. Like I love talking about business. It's like my favorite thing in the whole world. I draw pictures about business, I write books about this, I make course about business, make content about business, and then I do business in the meantime. Like, I fucking love business. And so that was the only thing that I felt passionate about. And so that's what I made the mission about. But as we've walked the path realizing that the reason the businesses have done really well for us is because of the cultures that we create. And we believe that those cultures create better businesses and honestly also better working environment, generate really good bottom line, but also really great experiences for the people who work there. And so I haven't been amped about it. And so the truth of why I want to go there now and now I see that a much bigger picture than I did when we started it two or three years ago. I think your reasons evolve. And so I think that it makes sense that I think it's both honestly personal goals. He had transferred money from that person's account to his to the degree that he could buy whatever he wanted. And so I think you just think more about it and you're like, why do I want to do this? Because you have to have a reason. Otherwise you go into a ball of nothingness. 

Sam Parr (0:54:16-0:54:28): Yeah, well, look, I think the best way to actually learn that we were talking about the last episode. We talked about what's the restaurant Panda Express guy and we were like. 

Alex Hormozi (0:54:30-0:54:30): He. 

Sam Parr (0:54:30-0:55:22): Just sells like orange chicken. That's not exactly inspiring, but like he he employs like 20,000 people and he like gives these guys I think he we were talking about I have my notes here. He gives them all. Like he pays a little bit for them to go to Tony Robbins. He gives them, like, the thinking Grow Rich books and all these books, and he's like, yeah, like, the whole chicken shit. That's kind of cool and all, but I'm actually taking an hourly wage worker, and we're trying to elevate them. And so I'm like, oh, I can get behind that. I'm in on that. And if you look at a lot of non tech or non Silicon Valley companies, employ 30,000 people, and they're like, yeah, we sell tires, and that's cool, but I'm really just trying to, like, we create jobs, and that's very fascinating, and that's really exciting, and that's cool. It's better for the economy or some of these really boring brick and mortar businesses. I think that's actually where you see a lot of really cool missions. Or, like, if you I've read the have you read about the Koch brothers? 

Alex Hormozi (0:55:24-0:55:25): You mean coke? Like coke industries? 

Sam Parr (0:55:25-0:56:09): Yeah, coke industries. So basically, it started with the dad. He was, like, an oil guy, and then they used the byproduct of creating oil to create all types of plastics and whatever. And so now it's arguably it goes back and forth as the biggest privately owned company in America. And he was like, no, my whole thing is, like, freedom for people, and I want to teach them that they have autonomy. And through working here, he's got a whole book on his management systems, and he's like, more so what I'm inspired about is empowering people. And so, anyway, when I read about those older companies, I actually think that that's a bit more inspiring than some doric saying that he's changing the world one computer ship at a time, when it's like, I don't know. That's not exactly inspiring. 

Alex Hormozi (0:56:09-0:56:10): Maybe it hasn't played out yet. 

Sam Parr (0:56:11-0:56:12): Yeah. 

Alex Hormozi (0:56:13-0:57:03): Bill Gates said when he started was like, I want to have a computer, and everyone's like, okay. And then he did it. And so I think part of it is also, like, what snapshot on the timeline are we looking at? But I 100% agree with you, because basically it shifts from internal to external. Like, in the beginning, you do it for you, obviously. You do it because you get praised instead of punished. Like, you have good more good shit than bad shit. So you keep doing it, but once the thing that was good no longer, like, the diminishing return of the pleasure of more money isn't there anymore, then you have to find a new you find a new goal, like you said. And if it also coincides with other people being motivated by not making Alex rich, but by proving a point that we can create companies that reward instead of punish and actually have better returns, I'm juiced, and we haven't proved it yet. That's fine. We haven't proved it yet. We will. 

Shaan Puri (0:57:03-0:57:47): I want to ask you two questions. The first is around people you admire. So we talked about the panda express guy on our Just on Our Own last episode because we were featuring those, like, crazy, rich Asians, basically was the third of the episode, and then it turns out he lives near you or whatever. You're both in Vegas. Who are some people that you admire? So I always find this interesting to hear who kind of stands out and why for different folks. So who are some people that you admire, either past or present? People that you've met? Because I know that this kind of, like, getting famous on YouTube thing opens up a bunch of doors. You meet a bunch of cool people that you otherwise, you expand your circle of people you get to know through this stuff. So who are some people that you admire? 

Alex Hormozi (0:57:47-1:00:35): Well, I definitely admire Andrew Patron from Panda Express because they're a married couple who built this whole thing, and they never I got outside money, and they've owned the whole thing. Privately, they have 2600 locations. They do 3.7 billion a year with 27% net margins, and they take $935,000,000 a year in personal income. And I think that's only possible because they have created a new vision for what they wanted the company to be about, which is about their employees. I am inspired by Warren Buffett, you know what I mean? I am because of the long term mentality that he has. And he built Berkshire Hathaway. And in some ways, I feel like he has, like, a beautiful life story of just believing in the power of compounding and patience. And that's what I feel like his virtues are that he's demonstrated in rational decision making. I would say that for us, it's like if we can build something like that, but just with our own spin, our own zest, which is around praise, not punishment, and building companies that we can win by their scoreboard, but we do it our way. So that's the Warren angle. And, I mean, I admire Elon a lot, a ton, just like what we were talking about earlier, his ability to see vision and connect to a larger mission. He's been able to masterfully do that in every single company he's been a part of. And his track record is incredibly fucking impressive, and he just continues to defy the laws of what seems to be normal or possible over and over and over again. And so I think just like how he just stares into the abyss and says, like, let's do it, I think that's something that I really, really admire. He obviously has flaws like all of us do, but I think he also has been really good about owning his flaws and being public about that. He's just a human, and I think he may create a new model for how big public CEOs run, and maybe that maybe we're in the beginning of that world. And I think on the totally other side of the coin, I think I admire what Mr. Beast has done from a personal branding perspective, I've been able to get to know him really well. Jim thinks really big and has a tremendous work ethic. And I think seeing the merger, seeing where all these things are, like, Elon has been able to build a personal brand, and in a lot of ways, if you're a fan of Elon, you want to buy all of the things. He just happens to have enormous Monetization vehicles. And to your point, Sam, about how they use, like, yeah, sure, we make tires. Yes, sure, we sell orange chicken. In a lot of ways, I see, like, all the companies we have in acquisition.com is like, yeah, of course we transact, we build businesses. But the reason we do it is this. And I think that's really dope. And so those are probably the if you were to mix, like, what are the things that I'm drawing inspiration from at Burn. And if you look at what we're doing, it probably would make sense to see all three of those as the three biggest kind of influencers. You got, like, Mr. Beast on personal brand side here. You've got Warren Buffett on the investment side and then Elon from the big vision. And I feel like those three things are probably where I draw the most inspiration from in terms of our day to day and what we're trying to do. 

Sam Parr (1:00:35-1:00:49): What's interesting about you is that you're pretty good at you're very catchy. So, like, the whole knees to feet thing is pretty awesome. And then what was the line for your current company? It was reward versus punish. 

Alex Hormozi (1:00:52-1:00:54): We would have beat them at their game and we wouldn't do it our way. 

Sam Parr (1:00:55-1:02:07): Well, you said we want to use their scoreboard, but do it our way. So you're quite lyrical. You've also done a few there's, like, actually a handful of things that you've talked about very casually that I've caught onto that I really like. So, for example, you say dessert. What do you say dessert every day or never skip dessert? Never skip dessert. And then you also because your whole dieting thing is you eat all of your protein earlier on, and then you're like, all right, now I have fat and carbs. We can go big on those. You've done a few things outside of business that I find almost more impressive or I actually use on my daily life, more so than your business stuff, which I actually found is pretty funny. You also have I don't know if you've seen this, Sean, but if you Google, there's this, like, 23 year old Alex who does a thing where he's like, I'm going to do a bulk over the next eight weeks. And he has, like, before, during and after photos and that stuff I look at significantly more than a lot of your business stuff. I find that some of your fitness and diet stuff, like, more interesting, applicable in my day to day life than the business stuff. I'm shocked that a living. 

Alex Hormozi (1:02:08-1:02:45): I joked about it in the comments once. I was like, people, like, admire our my way of thinking about things in business. And I was like, for a decade I did that with fitness. I just don't talk about it because everyone feels entitled to opinion because they have a body. I hate getting into that. They're like, well, what about salt? I'm like, Dude, just fuck off. I have so little patience for it because I'm like, look at you. And if you were more in shape and by the way, no one who's been more in shape than me has ever criticized any of the content I ever had. It's just like people who are wealthier than you never say shit about business advice. No one ahead of you ever should tell. 

Sam Parr (1:02:45-1:03:14): Well, the cool thing about it is I use the fitness analogy a ton in business because I'm like, well, it's hard, but it's simple. In that if you lift this much weight and eat like this for a year, you're not necessarily going to look like Arnold or be lean or whatever, but you're going to be pretty good or better than where you are now. And you just got to do it for like, two years and you got to be fairly strict about it. So that's why the carryover is quite fun watching you do both of those things. 

Alex Hormozi (1:03:14-1:03:27): I appreciate it. Yeah. I mean, simple not easy, I feel like is the fucking theme of so many things like fitness, nutrition, marriage, business. Like simple to do or simple to understand, conceptually, very hard to do. 

Shaan Puri (1:03:28-1:03:31): What's the simple not easy for marriage. 

Alex Hormozi (1:03:31-1:03:46): I think it's it's reward more than you punish. I mean, it actually comes down to that. So, like, okay, if I want my wife to scratch my back more, I have to wait until she scratches my back of her own volition, and then I have to reward her immediately. And then she will want reward more, and so she will do it again. 

Shaan Puri (1:03:46-1:03:48): Very pavlovian of you. 

Alex Hormozi (1:03:48-1:03:59): Well, yeah, I mean, I think we're all though, you know what I mean? Fundamentally, there's three things you can do when anyone does anything around you is that you can punish them for doing it, you can ignore that they did it, or you can praise them for doing it. 

Shaan Puri (1:03:59-1:04:01): Have you ever heard the Tony Robbins. 

Alex Hormozi (1:04:02-1:04:03): Like, I forget what he calls it. 

Shaan Puri (1:04:03-1:04:37): But it's like the four styles of being in a relationship. He says something like this. Have you heard this thing? It's like the first one. Let me see if I can remember it off top of my head. So basically he goes, first one's like a baby. It's like, I need love and I don't have to give anything to you. So it's just like I cry, you give, and that's it. You better be happy with that arrangement. So that's like one relationship you can have, one style of relationship you can have, and obviously doesn't work out very well. Once you're an adult, you can't just cry, expect to be given everything you want and then not have to do anything in return. 

Sam Parr (1:04:38-1:04:40): Baby love. So that's baby love. 

Shaan Puri (1:04:40-1:05:21): Then he has the next one, which is basically tit for tat. And this is where almost everybody falls into. So this is probably going to sound familiar to at least to an extent, and it is probably the root of all problems in relationships is tit for tat, which is you measure what you get and then you give based on that. When you're given a lot, you give a lot. But then as soon as somebody breaks the cycle and they short you, consciously or unconsciously, they don't do what you wanted. You also withdraw or pull back some amount of giving and then they reciprocate. They also measure and pull back, and both sides do that. And you end up with sort of a race to the bottom. And so that's tit for tat, and that's where most people stand. And it's just a cycle that resets. 

Alex Hormozi (1:05:21-1:05:22): Over and over again. 

Shaan Puri (1:05:23-1:05:46): The next one is unconditional love, which is basically I give regardless of what you give back. I give because that's who I am. I give because that's how I want to roll in my relationship, and I control what I control, and obviously that's way better. And to me, that's the simple not easy of being in a relationship is just go unconditional mode rather than TIFF or tat. And then he has some higher one, which is monk love or something like. 

Sam Parr (1:05:46-1:05:48): That he calls it, where it's spiritual love. 

Shaan Puri (1:05:48-1:06:08): It's like, I love you even though you hate me. Like, a monk can be like, I pray for and love even my enemies and those trying to hurt me. And he's like, nobody gets there. But that's aspirationally what you could get to as well is love. Like a monk who loves even their enemies and those who try to cause harm. And so those are the four levels. 

Alex Hormozi (1:06:08-1:06:09): Of love I remembered. 

Sam Parr (1:06:10-1:06:28): Alex, do you ever so, like, I saw this video of you the other day, and now everyone's giving you a hard time or they're just teasing you in a good way about your outfit because you wear the same clothing all the time. So you made a funny video about it and you go instead of just saying, oh, it's comfortable, you go, Dude, I'm just more Darwinian to them. These shorts. 

Alex Hormozi (1:06:28-1:06:29): You want to go work out? 

Sam Parr (1:06:29-1:06:30): I can go work out. 

Alex Hormozi (1:06:30-1:06:32): You want to go to restroom? 

Sam Parr (1:06:32-1:06:42): Yeah, that's what he said. He goes, you want to go swimming? These are waterproof. You want to go out to a restaurant? He's like, Just good enough that I can go and do that. I can do anyone. I can do anything. I'm Darwinian. 

Alex Hormozi (1:06:42-1:06:42): You're not. 

Sam Parr (1:06:42-1:06:43): I win. 

Shaan Puri (1:06:43-1:07:11): You lose. I bought the shoes you invented because you were like, these sandals, these are the perfect sandal for working out, running through, walking through rain, climbing a hill, or being at the office. And in the comments, everyone's like, yeah, what's the sandal? What's the sandal? Where's the affiliate link? We can't find it. And then some dude, like, 50 comments down is like, dude, that's what it's this brand, the night shade color of this. All right? Respect to this guy for finding it. I'm going to go buy this thing. 

Sam Parr (1:07:13-1:07:29): Does your mom and dad ever like, hey, quit being such a douche, and we just wear what we bought you? Because be nice? At what point are you like, this makes sense for me. And also it's good for the brand versus live a little and let's just fuck around? 

Alex Hormozi (1:07:30-1:08:25): Do you know what I mean? Yeah, good for the brand is actually not really a thought when it comes to it. I believe that brand comes as a result of rather than conscious, you know what I mean? People were like, so wouldn't you think of never skipped dessert? I was like, I was making fun of fitness people because my original audience was fitness people who obsessed about not eating cookies. And I was like, Fuck off. You know what I mean? Like, eat dessert. You know what I mean? But do it in a way that you can sell a six pack the whole time. So that was I never skipped. It was always like, never skip leg day. Never skip Monday. I was like, Never skip sir. Like, the calves thing is because I genuinely have started training. I start every training session since a girl told me that she thought that my calves weren't big. It's been like, twelve years, 14 years that I start every session with calves. And so my calves have grown a lot. And so everyone's like, Jeanette, my calves were sticks, and I trained the ship. So, like, is it part of my brand? Yeah, because it's in some ways, like it's true. 

Shaan Puri (1:08:25-1:08:30): Lindsay, Lindsay, 14 years of fuel you gave me. 

Alex Hormozi (1:08:31-1:09:57): The outfit thing is actually because it's my content team that wanted to make content about it, because they're like, dude, you're fucking maniac with this. I feel like people should know this because everyone who knows you in person knows that when they walked in for almost a year and a half, there was stacks of shoeboxes, and I would wear different shoes for an hour a day a week. And they kind of graduated to like if they're good enough where I can walk around the apartment, then I'll walk around for their day. If I can walk around with them for a week. And I still like them. And most of them never got there. So I have a few finalists that got to that point, but I think I just obsessed about making things better. Same things. Like, if I do end up doing a you know, if there is a good enough company that does no strips like I'm going to iterate the product a bunch of times until I think it's absolutely untouchable. And then I'll say, this is the one I use. And I can say that. I say that with confidence because I did the work on it. For me, I just hate having to change. I don't know what it is. It means that I started my day not thinking about what I was going to do. So I was like, okay, well, if I can create a setup or a uniform for myself that I can be in the most environments. So for me, I'm really never in less than 40 degree weather, ever, because I usually tend to be in warmer spots of the country in general. And so this outfit goes 40 to 120 degrees, and I can go to the gym. I can go to the pool. I can walk for hours. I can walk all day. I can go to a nice restaurant. I can do all those things because. 

Shaan Puri (1:09:57-1:09:59): If they need but that's crazy because. 

Sam Parr (1:09:59-1:10:05): Your wife, who I've seen, she dresses lovely. She like, it's fashionable, so her hair always looks nice. 

Alex Hormozi (1:10:06-1:10:06): You know what I mean? 

Shaan Puri (1:10:06-1:10:16): Like I said, it goes 40 to 120. Like a car goes zero to 60. This flannel jacket right here, this thing goes 40 to 120. 

Alex Hormozi (1:10:17-1:10:47): Once it's below 40, I get cold, so I have to put pants. But up until then, I'm pretty much good within that range. And so I can button think this thing can go full sleeves, and that's when I'm in mass cold mode. Or if I go to a restaurant that requires sleeves, I can have that, right? But otherwise, I'm in beater mode. We go to the gym, we go to the pool, we go to beach, we go wherever I'm going to be in beater mode. You know what I mean? I tried to drive. 

Shaan Puri (1:10:51-1:10:52): Mode like a car. 

Alex Hormozi (1:10:52-1:12:02): Well, my whole outfit has sports mode. People are like proxy sport. Like, my whole outfit has sports mode and comfort mode and weather mode, and I can do that. I enjoyed finding each of these things almost as much as I enjoy wearing them every morning. And this is true every morning when I put this on, I get like a little boost where I'm like I know that I've picked every single one of these pieces out, and I have no doubt that this is the best thing for me for my day. And so I know that the brand of white beaver that I have on right now, I tried 40 or 50 other brands on, and I knew this one sat where I wanted to sit. It wasn't too thick on the shoulder or too thin. It didn't drop into some string on the back. Some people like that. I didn't want that. Beaters themselves are thinner than tank tops. They're ribs so that they fit right. I think even have you ever seen those Under Armour tank tops? Or those, like, shrink wrap ones? They don't look good. I think they look synthetic for me. I think they look like kind of synthetic. E like, I don't like it. I like cotton better. And so it was just a number of iterations. Like, if I talked about the shoe, I could tell you a zillion things that I looked at. I have, like, an Excel sheet that. 

Sam Parr (1:12:02-1:12:21): I thought you would have. I have a few friends like that. I'm not as extreme, but I like buying and testing a ton of stuff. Sean wears ordered, like, 20 of the same shirts. What products this is actually interesting. I don't think this is like, too inside baseball, but what products and brands do you obsess with and love in your daily life? 

Alex Hormozi (1:12:21-1:13:13): Well, I won't say them because I'm in talks with, like, hassle to try and figure something out. But I will caveat that with I think that in general, for people, my life might be different than theirs. And I think just being delivered, so many people are just, like, sleepwalking through life that they're always sitting there with their pants that just don't fit just right or always don't have this thing. A lot of stuff I modify. So my gym bag like, there was a video about my gym bag. I tried out a bunch of different bags and I finally found a bag that I liked and then I modified the shit out of it and like, that bag. Now every time I go into a gym, people are like, Dude, that bag's awesome. I was like, I know, because I made it for this function and it's great and I love it. It's really good. So I think it's more just like finding the whatever your 40 to 120 is. Because maybe you live in Michigan and it's always cold. It's like, well, you're going to have a different standard. 

Sam Parr (1:13:13-1:13:14): What standard? 

Alex Hormozi (1:13:14-1:13:15): Wear? 

Sam Parr (1:13:15-1:13:19): What shorts are they? I thought you used to wear just shorts. I used to make fun of you for wearing. 

Alex Hormozi (1:13:19-1:13:55): I used to Jordan. But George, I'll tell you, I used to wear jords because they were more comfortable and I could do more casual settings with them right. Than always showing up in athletic shorts. It looked like, almost too casual, I think. And a lot of restaurants are like, no athletic wear. And so I was like, okay, well, that's annoying. And so then it went through this whole thing where I had to find the best short. And then while I was doing that, the ones that I have have back hooks on them so that if I can hang them too dry. I've got an iPhone pocket in there that's built in because I hate having to sit. And then you take it out of your pocket every time. It's such a. 

Sam Parr (1:13:55-1:13:56): Pain. 

Alex Hormozi (1:13:56-1:14:11): There should be a pocket for this. Everyone has one, right? And there's, like, a little place that I can plug an iPad pencil in my shorts because I use my iPad a lot. Like, I've got cargo on the other side, and these are stretchy, but not too stretchy, but they're stretchy. 

Sam Parr (1:14:12-1:14:14): What freight you hauling in there, buddy? What do you got? 

Alex Hormozi (1:14:15-1:14:15): What do you need? 

Shaan Puri (1:14:15-1:14:17): The car gummy bears? 

Alex Hormozi (1:14:18-1:14:40): No. A lot of times, it's mic packs, so a lot of times it's mic packs, because we're getting, like, right now, my mic packs in my cargo pocket, but I could fit a water bottle in here if I need it. Or a hotel key, like hotel keys there whenever we're traveling. Or I use my Nicorette because I actually nicorette, so I'll have Nicarette in my pocket if I go on a podcast. So I always have the stuff that I need there. 

Sam Parr (1:14:40-1:14:41): Well, it's weird. 

Shaan Puri (1:14:42-1:15:01): The best way possible, man. These are my favorite kinds of pods. When you find out, it's like, I want to see your weird, that's when I know you. Until I see you're weird, I don't actually know you. I feel this is my this is my personal my personal thing. And I'm glad we went down this rabbit hole because we got to see your weird. 

Alex Hormozi (1:15:01-1:15:59): It's funny, because right now, Maya actually, I'm not going to show you the brand, but I've got this backpack here, right? And this backpack, I can wear it, like, when we travel. I can wear it everywhere. And it has everything that I used to travel, and I can travel for four weeks with that because all I have to pack is the repairs of shorts that are identical, that are multi everything. And then I just have an amount of tanks that is whatever the laundry cycle of the trip is, and that's it. And I could put one flannel on top, and I'm good. And I don't even have to use the expansion part of that backpack, which I have options if I need it. And it has a cool front thing for all my wires that's flat, so it doesn't take up space. There's just a lot I like. And I went through a zillion different bags to find that. I went through a zillion different bags to find the gym bag, but, like no, when whenever I pick it up, I'm like, this is the best bag to the job. 

Sam Parr (1:16:00-1:16:10): You seem like a clutter free guy. Like, do you have a cleaner who comes to your home very often and someone who does laundry? And also do you not own a lot of stuff? 

Alex Hormozi (1:16:10-1:16:55): I don't. Layla does. Right. That backpack and tank tops. I can fit my entire wardrobe on my bedside table, and so super easy. And when I was trying stuff on, one of our assists will come, and they'll return anything that I don't use or whatever. But I think the underlying point here is Layla doesn't do that at all because she doesn't like that at all. She broke, really poor, always wanted to have nice clothes, and now that she can, she loves wearing nice clothes, and she feels good wearing nice clothes, and she gets hit up by the designers to go to the runway things, because she wear, like, one piece of her wardrobe. Is the entire cost of my wardrobe, like, one piece, like a top. 

Shaan Puri (1:16:55-1:17:15): What the best way you spend money for you personally? Not, like, a business investment that you think it's a great ROI, or you get a bunch of joy out of it, or it's, like, dope for you that is, let's say, not your content team and not, like, something that's directly in the business. 

Alex Hormozi (1:17:15-1:17:22): Yeah, I mean, I would say JSX is wonderful since it's in the Southwest, so it's, like, semi private flying. 

Sam Parr (1:17:23-1:17:24): It's pretty good. 

Alex Hormozi (1:17:24-1:19:01): Oh, it's great. The only reason we fly private is because it saves the only reason we do it, and a lot less hassle. But JSX allows you all the benefits of private flying. This is like a fucking JSX plug, but it's really good, and it tickets, like, $300 when it would normally be, like, 50. So if you want to fly JSX from Vegas to Salt Lake or Vegas to Scottsdale or Vegas to La. It's $300. It's nothing, right? And you walk up to the plane, you get on the plane, and then you walk off the plane. That's it. You know what I mean? It's just, like, private. There's just a few other people there, and private flying, in my opinion, has the most benefit for the shortest travels and the least benefit for the long travels, because long travels, you want to fly as high as possible, as fast as possible. The bigger the plane, the better. And by percentage of the trip, going through security and dealing with the hassle, if you have a five and a half hour flight, five and a half hours versus, like, 7 hours of transit, the day screwed. It doesn't materially change a lot, but on a short travel where you're going, like sub, I would say sub 2 hours, you can double the length of the trip or triple the length of the trip by going in reverse, cut it in half or by a third by flying private. And so that's where I feel like you get the highest marginal benefit. It's also the cheapest private flight to the shortest ones because it's by hour. So that's kind of like when we go back and forth, and usually the only times we'll fly private is if we can't get a direct JSX flight. 

Sam Parr (1:19:02-1:19:31): We'll wrap up in a second here, but last time you were here, sean asked a question about your portfolio, and I want to follow up on it. What's your portfolio looking like in terms of both your private investments as well as what are you doing with your money? Are you keeping in equities bonds? Cash? I think last time you were super heavy cash, if I remember correctly. Yeah, that's what it was. It was Treasuries. You're like. I'm almost entirely treasuries. What's it looking right now in terms of if you could do, like, a pie chart and percentages? 

Alex Hormozi (1:19:32-1:19:36): Probably still half Treasuries, except now they're. 

Sam Parr (1:19:36-1:19:38): A lot better than before. 

Alex Hormozi (1:19:38-1:19:46): Yeah, they're probably half Treasuries. Probably have a quarter in just, like, indexes, and the other quarter is in. 

Sam Parr (1:19:46-1:19:49): Private companies, so pretty simple. 

Alex Hormozi (1:19:50-1:20:16): Yeah, probably not by value. Over time, that treasury part is going to continue to decline as we do more and more deals. But yeah, I still think that, like, I mean, I don't know what the future looks like, so I like, I I tend to like having lots of cash. Like, I feel good. I I never want to not be able to do a deal that's going to ten X because I don't have cash. The cost of missing the ten X is well worth the, quote, inflation that I'm suffering for the difference between the treasury yield and the inflation cost. 

Sam Parr (1:20:16-1:20:19): And yeah, I would imagine you probably don't own a car, and you seem. 

Alex Hormozi (1:20:19-1:20:26): Like you'd be right. So Leila has one of those H two electric Hummer pickup trucks. 

Sam Parr (1:20:26-1:20:28): Oh, my gosh, that's hilarious. Yeah, the huge one. 

Alex Hormozi (1:20:29-1:20:45): Yeah. She was like, I want it. I was like, okay, it's not really my way to do that. Mine would be if it were me, I would have a Dodge Caravan that was like, all blacked out, tinted windows with the TVs, you know what I mean? In the back, like, sliding door as I pull up. That would be more my style. 

Sam Parr (1:20:45-1:20:48): And are you renting you'renting still or do you own that place? 

Alex Hormozi (1:20:49-1:21:08): No, we just bought a place we were renting for a couple of years, and then Leila found one that she was like, I want this one. So I was like, all right, get it. We just moved today, actually, or yesterday was the official move. So that's why my background is now my office closet. But we're actually retrofitting a closet here to be my office. 

Sam Parr (1:21:08-1:21:40): Dude. I heard that Derek from more plates, more dates. I had heard a story. So he basically started his whole video thing when he was no one and he just had a shitty apartment. And I had heard a story that he the original video was just him on a white wall, that he cut that white wall and put it into each of his now nicer homes or apartments. I had heard he took that wall with him everywhere, so even the shade was the same. I don't know if that's true, but I had heard that and I thought that was pretty funny. 

Alex Hormozi (1:21:41-1:21:52): I'm a big believer that Derek obviously knows what he's doing. I just always just want, like, if I move you guys, like, my background will change, and you'll know that, like, something has changed my life. 

Sam Parr (1:21:52-1:21:55): You know what I mean? Well, he's way more private than you. 

Alex Hormozi (1:21:55-1:22:16): Yeah, he's way more private. He doesn't want anyone in his last name, et cetera. Different strokes. I think on a long enough time horizon, everyone will find out your last name. I mean, Lady Gaga. I tried to go by Gaga, but you can Wikipedia her name, so you can find it if you get famous enough. And I figure that we will get famous enough, and so it hasn't been something that I've tried to protect a ton. 

Sam Parr (1:22:16-1:22:24): Well, thank you for coming on again. If you go to our YouTube page, my first smelling you're actually like the I don't know what they call that video, but you're like our main page. 

Shaan Puri (1:22:24-1:22:26): Video for a while. 

Sam Parr (1:22:26-1:22:37): Yeah, and it's like a quote of like, I've come to the conclusion that I just like to work, and I don't like when people ask me, why am I working all the time? Or something like that. But thanks for doing this again, and we really appreciate it. 

Alex Hormozi (1:22:37-1:22:47): No, I mean, thank you guys for having me on, and thank you for the audience for maybe making requests to have me back on. So I appreciate it, and it means a lot to me. So thank you guys for just being awesome host in general. 

Sam Parr (1:22:47-1:22:49): Awesome. Well, that's the pod. 

Alex Hormozi (1:22:51-1:22:59): I feel like I could rule the world. I know I could be what I want to. I put my all in it like, no days off on the road. 

Shaan Puri (1:22:59-1:23:02): Let's travel, never looking back.
