Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Does this say the call is recording for you at all? 

Eliza (ACME Co): But it says the request, the report or in here? 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Nice. All right… one sec. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Cool. Absolutely. Well, I tell you what, thank you very much for joining me today. 

Eliza (ACME Co): Yeah, glad to be chatting with you Greg. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Absolutely. Well. So, first of all, my name is Greg and I am from Marin transitions and we help people do social modeling on top of their businesses. So say somebody were to mention you on read it or mentioned you on Twitter or Facebook, then we help you understand what they're saying and the sentiment behind it. And I'm very excited to be chatting with you today. My first awesome. Well, I'll tell you what I've looked at your LinkedIn a little bit, but could you tell me more about your position and what you do? 

Eliza (ACME Co): Absolutely. So I am cmo over at acmico and we are a software company that helps nonprofits grow their business. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Awesome. That's fabulous. And how many employees does acmico have? 

Eliza (ACME Co): We have about 45 employees today. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Nice. That's great. And how big is the marketing team? 

Eliza (ACME Co): The marketing team is, I think seven of us today. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Awesome. That's cool. And what technology stack does acme co use? 

Eliza (ACME Co): So, today, we are using slack photoshop, Hubspot, Zoom and Google cloud. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): That's awesome. And so, because we do social monitoring, I wanna go into a little bit of questions around your social experience, if you will, and what acne code does. So, how many times would you say that you post on social media per month? 

Eliza (ACME Co): I'd say about 10 times a month? 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Interesting. And do you do any sort of social monitoring today? Do you know what customers are saying about you on those platforms? 

Eliza (ACME Co): No, we have no idea. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Interesting. And what are the pain points you're having by not being able to do social monitoring? 

Eliza (ACME Co): Yeah, I'd say the pain points of not having social monitoring revolve around the lack of transparency. So we're by not understanding what our customers are saying about us on social media, that is a disadvantage in a very competitive market. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Yeah, absolutely. And would you or I guess, let me rephrase how valuable would it be to you to understand what customers are saying about your brand in real time? 

Eliza (ACME Co): I think it could have significant value to understand in real time. What's ap? 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Happening. Nice. And if you were to put a dollar amount on that, what would you say? What would you say? The dollar amount would be? 

Eliza (ACME Co): I would estimate, you know, if each… having this kind of transparency and visibility into our market, if that enables us to close one more deal per month. Now, with, given our average contract values, I'd say 50,000 dollars. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Yeah, no, that's very cool. And who would be the person that would sign off on this purchase? 

Eliza (ACME Co): So there would be, that would be a committee decision between myself and the rest of the leadership team. But the ultimate signer of the contract would be my CEO Christina. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Interesting. And so as we think about this social monitoring even more, what are your priorities for a tool? What would you like to see? 

Eliza (ACME Co): I would like to see a tool that is able to accurately… in real time, tell me about… the data that my customers are saying about the company about our product… to stay ahead of, you know, potential risks. So protect that revenue and our existing customers. And then in terms of criteria for a partner, we were looking for someone that we can scale with as we build out our marketing program and someone that's going to offer the hands on white glove support that we need. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Yeah, no, that's awesome. And what is the process to get a new deal across the finish? Line? So, what is your evaluation process look like? 

Eliza (ACME Co): So, it is usually pretty easy process for us being a, an agile team over here. That process looks like I evaluate vendors, narrow that list down. We have about two options narrowed down today, one being your company. And then from there, I'll present and make my recommendations to the CEO. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Nice and say you make a decision, you're happy with it, what is the paper process that you need to go through to complete the decision? Is there accounting or legal or anybody? 

Eliza (ACME Co): Yes, there is a legal and security review as part of the process which would be conducted by our in house council. So you could send through your terms at any point and we could get ahead of that review if that would be… helpful. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Yeah, that's sweet. What are the, what other tools are you looking at as a part of this evaluation? 

Eliza (ACME Co): We're also looking at Hootsuite. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Interesting. Well, first, I wanna thank you very much for being such a big supporter of what we're doing here at Marin transitions? 

Eliza (ACME Co): Absolutely. I'm happy to be your champion over here. I think, you know, based on the great conversations that I've had… with your team in the past and my last company… and also your, the recommendations that I've heard in referrals from some of your other customers in my peers have gone a long way. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): That's awesome. Do you have any questions for me? 

Eliza (ACME Co): Yeah. So as I mentioned, support is going to be important. I'm sure you're aware everyone is wanting to avoid shelfware these days. So what I'm curious about is how long does it take to get started on your platform? And what does that implementation process look? 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Absolutely. So the implementation process is really in two parts. Part number one is just gonna be a about an hour long session with one of our implementation partners and your head of social media that's just to make sure that your accounts get set up and that we're doing the tracking properly. Then part two is going to be the actual monitoring part. It takes about four hours to start monitoring, but after that, it'll be available for you in real time and that's just so we can go scrape all the data off the social sites. So that net you should be up and running in about half a day's work. That sounds. 

Eliza (ACME Co): Perfect. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Yeah, absolutely. Well, I tell you what, as a next step, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to share the brochure with you about our company that has all the information you may want on it. And I'm also going to share with you the pricing information as well. And so this is some deck that I'll send over. And so you can see that. And what I would love to do as a follow up is to schedule a new meeting with you for next week, probably on Wednesday. Is there a time that works on Wednesday for you? 

Eliza (ACME Co): Yes, I'm available any time between two and four PM on Wednesday, Pacific Time. So if you want that invite, I'll go ahead and accept it. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Cool. Absolutely. I'll send an invite for that time. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): One last thing too. I always like to get to know my prospects a bit more on a personal level too. Do you have any pets or animals inside the house that are close to you? 

Eliza (ACME Co): I do. In fact, I have an Australian Shepherd dog. He's very cute and very crazy. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Awesome. No, that's great. And what do you like to do outside of? 

Eliza (ACME Co): Well, I live in the beautiful bay area in the north bay just north of San Francisco. So my husband and I really enjoy hiking on the nearby trails. We enjoy wine tasting up in wine country… and those are a couple of our favorite things to do on the weekends. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): That's fabulous. Well, I tell you what, thank you very much for the conversation today and I'll follow up with you next week. 

Eliza (ACME Co): Great. I'm looking forward to. 

Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): It all right. We'll see you later. Bye bye.
