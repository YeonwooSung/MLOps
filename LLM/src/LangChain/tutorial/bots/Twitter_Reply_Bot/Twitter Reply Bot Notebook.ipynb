    "Here's how the final app will work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A user @mentions your bot, for me it will be @SiliconOracle\n",
    "2. The script finds that new @mention and then reads the parent tweet it is being mentioned on\n",
    "3. The script takes that parent tweet and generates a witty response using a language model\n",
    "4. Respond is posted and tweet is logged\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will focus on #3.\n",
    "\n",
