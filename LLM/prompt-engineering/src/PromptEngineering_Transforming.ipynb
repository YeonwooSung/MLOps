That's why I got this adorable panda plushie for my daughter's birthday, after she kept taking mine from my room. And let me tell you, it was a hit!\n\nThe plushie is super soft and cuddly, making it the perfect companion for my daughter. She takes it everywhere with her, and it has quickly become her favorite toy. However, I did notice that one of the ears is a bit lower than the other, which I don't think was designed to be asymmetrical. But that doesn't take away from its cuteness.\n\nThe only downside is that it's a bit small for the price I paid. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. But overall, I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was that it arrived a day earlier than expected. This gave me the chance to play with it myself before giving it to my daughter. And I have to say, I was impressed with the quality and attention to detail.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a soft and cute panda plushie for yourself or a loved one, this is definitely a great option. Just be aware that it might be a bit smaller than expected."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"oIIB7K34cwo2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686052369195,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"성연우","userId":"12015659827226767816"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]}]}
