title: How to Change Delivery Address
To change the delivery address for an order, go to your PetWorld account and select "Order History." Find the order you want to modify and click "Change Shipping Address." Enter the new address and save your changes. Please note that you can only change the address if the order hasn't been shipped yet. If your order is already in transit, contact our customer support team for assistance. For future orders, you can add or edit addresses in your account settings under "Saved Addresses."
