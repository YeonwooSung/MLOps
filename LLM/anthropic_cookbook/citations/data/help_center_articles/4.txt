title: Rewards Program: Points System
PetWorld's Rewards Program lets you earn points on every purchase. You'll receive 1 point for every $1 spent. Points can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases, with 100 points equal to $1 off. Points are automatically added to your account after your order ships and are valid for 12 months from the date of issue. You can check your point balance in the "Rewards" section of your account. Remember, you can earn bonus points through special promotions or by referring friends to PetWorld.
