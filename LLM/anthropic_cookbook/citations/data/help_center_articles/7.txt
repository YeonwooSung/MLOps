title: Cancelling a Subscription
To cancel a subscription, log in to your PetWorld account and go to "My Subscriptions." Select the subscription you wish to cancel and click "Cancel Subscription." You'll be asked to provide a reason for cancelling - this helps us improve our services. Your cancellation will be processed immediately, but you'll continue to receive any deliveries that have already been processed. If you change your mind, you can reactivate your subscription at any time. Please note that some promotional discounts may no longer apply if you reactivate a cancelled subscription.
