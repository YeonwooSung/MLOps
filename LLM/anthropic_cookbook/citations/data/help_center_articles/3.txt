title: Order Tracking Information
Once your order ships, you'll receive an email with a tracking number. To track your package, log in to your PetWorld account and go to "Order History." Click on the order you want to track and select "Track Package." This will show you the current status and estimated delivery date. You can also enter the tracking number directly on our shipping partner's website for more detailed information. If you haven't received a tracking number within 48 hours of your order confirmation, please contact our customer support team.
