1. We need to join the employees and departments tables to get the department information for each employee.
2. We'll filter for departments located in New York.

To approach this natural language query, I will break it down into the following steps:

1. Identify the relevant tables and columns needed to answer the query.
- The relevant tables are 'employees' and 'departments'.
- The relevant columns are 'salary' and 'department_id' from the 'employees' table, and 'location' and 'id' from the 'departments' table.

2. Filter the data to only include employees from departments located in New York.
- This can be done by joining the 'employees' and 'departments' tables on the 'department_id' and 'id' columns, and then filtering the 'location' column to only include 'New York'.

3. Group the data by department and count the number of employees in each department.
- This can be done using a GROUP BY clause on the 'department_id' column.

4. Filter the data to only include departments with more than 5 employees.
- This can be done using a HAVING clause to filter the result of the GROUP BY operation.

5. Calculate the average salary for the remaining employees.
- This can be done using an AVG() aggregate function on the 'salary' column.

3. Calculate average salaries for 2022 and 2023 separately using subqueries.

5. Group by department name and order the results.

Note: We'll need to use subqueries because SQLite doesn't support window functions.

To solve this query, I will need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average salary for each department.
2. Compare each employee's salary to the average salary of their department.
3. Select the employees who earn above their department's average salary, and calculate the percentage difference.

To calculate the average salary for each department, I will need to join the `employees` and `departments` tables on the `department_id` column, and then group the results by the `name` column of the `departments` table to get the average salary for each department.

I can then compare each employee's salary to the average salary of their department by joining the results of the first query with the original `employees` table. This will allow me to calculate the percentage difference between the employee's salary and their department's average salary.
