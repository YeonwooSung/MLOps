On the right side, you\u2019ll see output like\nResponseThe ocean is salty due to several factors:\n\n1. Weathering of rocks: Over millions of years, rain, rivers, and streams have eroded rocks containing mineral salts. These salts are carried into the ocean by water runoff.\n2. Volcanic activity: Underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents release minerals, including salts, into the ocean water.\n3. Atmospheric deposition: Salt particles from ocean spray can be carried by wind and deposited back into the ocean.\n4. Evaporation: As water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, it leaves behind dissolved salts, increasing the concentration of salt in the remaining water.\n5. Biological processes: Some marine organisms contribute to the ocean's salinity by releasing salt compounds as byproducts of their metabolism.\n\nOver time, these processes have continuously added salts to the ocean, while evaporation removes pure water, leading to the ocean's current salinity levels. It's important to note that the total amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively stable because the input of salts is balanced by the removal of salts through processes like the formation of evaporite deposits.\nResponse\nResponse\n\nThe ocean is salty due to several factors:\n\n1.

For example, only allowing Claude to respond to questions with poems. We can control the format, tone, and personality of the response by adding a System Prompt.\nSystem promptYou are a world-class poet.

LLMs respond well to clear and direct instructions. You can put the role instructions in either the system prompt or the user message. We recommend testing to see which way yields the best results for your use case.\nOnce you\u2019ve tweaked the inputs such that you\u2019re pleased with the output\u2013-and have a good sense how to use Claude\u2013-convert your Workbench into an integration.\nClick Get Code to copy the generated code representing your Workbench session.\nClick Get Code to copy the generated code representing your Workbench session.\n\nClick Get Code to copy the generated code representing your Workbench session.\n"

Here, it\u2019s used to rate the tone of responses on a scale from 1 to 5. It\u2019s ideal for evaluating nuanced aspects like empathy, professionalism, or patience that are difficult to quantify with traditional metrics.

Here, it\u2019s used to classify whether a response contains PHI or not. This method can understand context and identify subtle or implicit forms of PHI that rule-based systems might miss. Example eval test cases : 500 simulated patient queries, some with PHI. import anthropic\n\npatient_queries = [ { \"query\" : \"What are the side effects of Lisinopril?\" , \"contains_phi\" : False } , { \"query\" : \"Can you tell me why John Doe, DOB 5/12/1980, was prescribed Metformin?\" , \"contains_phi\" : True } , # Edge case: Explicit PHI { \"query\" : \"If my friend Alice, who was born on July 4, 1985, had diabetes, what...\" , \"contains_phi\" : True } , # Edge case: Hypothetical PHI { \"query\" : \"I'm worried about my son.

Larger or more domain-specific data generally produces better in-domain embeddings\nInference performance: embedding lookup speed and end-to-end latency. This is a particularly important consideration for large scale production deployments\nCustomization: options for continued training on private data, or specialization of models for very specific domains.

    "text": "Limitations\n\n\nWhile Claude\u2019s image understanding capabilities are cutting-edge, there are some limitations to be aware of:\nPeople identification: Claude cannot be used to identify (i.e., name) people in images and will refuse to do so.\nAccuracy: Claude may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting low-quality, rotated, or very small images under 200 pixels.\nSpatial reasoning: Claude\u2019s spatial reasoning abilities are limited. It may struggle with tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or describing exact positions of chess pieces.\nCounting: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not always be precisely accurate, especially with large numbers of small objects.\nAI generated images: Claude does not know if an image is AI-generated and may be incorrect if asked. Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images.\nInappropriate content: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that violate our Acceptable Use Policy.\nHealthcare applications: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claude\u2019s outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.\nAlways carefully review and verify Claude\u2019s image interpretations, especially for high-stakes use cases. Do not use Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive image analysis without human oversight.\n"

    "text": "FAQ\n\n\nWhat image file types does Claude support? Claude currently supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP image formats, specifically: image/jpeg image/png image/gif image/webp Can Claude read image URLs? No, Claude cannot read image URLs on any interface, including on claude.ai. Our API does not currently support adding URLs in either the text or image blocks. Adding image URLs (or URLs of any sort) in the text block might cause Claude to hallucinate, as Claude is currently unable to retrieve information from that URL. Is there a limit to the image file size I can upload? Yes, there are limits: API: Maximum 5MB per image claude.ai: Maximum 10MB per image Images larger than these limits will be rejected and return an error when using our API. How many images can I include in one request? The image limits are: Messages API: Up to 20 images per request claude.ai: Up to 5 images per turn Requests exceeding these limits will be rejected and return an error. Does Claude read image metadata? No, Claude does not parse or receive any metadata from images passed to it. Can I delete images I've uploaded? No. Image uploads are ephemeral and not stored beyond the duration of the API request. Uploaded images are automatically deleted after they have been processed. Where can I find details on data privacy for image uploads? Please refer to our privacy policy page for information on how we handle uploaded images and other data. We do not use uploaded images to train our models. What if Claude's image interpretation seems wrong? If Claude\u2019s image interpretation seems incorrect: Ensure the image is clear, high-quality, and correctly oriented. Try prompt engineering techniques to improve results. If the issue persists, flag the output in claude.ai (thumbs up/down) or contact our support team. Your feedback helps us improve! Can Claude generate or edit images? No, Claude is an image understanding model only. It can interpret and analyze images, but it cannot generate, produce, edit, manipulate, or create images.\nWhat image file types does Claude support?

You can do this by specifying the tool in the tool_choice field like so:\ntool_choice = {\"type\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"get_weather\"}\ntool_choice = {\"type\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"get_weather\"}\ntool_choice = {\"type\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"get_weather\"}\n```\ntool_choice = {\"type\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"get_weather\"}\n\n```\nWhen working with the tool_choice parameter, we have three possible options:\nauto allows Claude to decide whether to call any provided tools or not. This is the default value.\nany tells Claude that it must use one of the provided tools, but doesn\u2019t force a particular tool.\ntool allows us to force Claude to always use a particular tool.\nThis diagram illustrates how each option works:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when you have tool_choice as any or tool, we will prefill the assistant message to force a tool to be used. This means that the models will not emit a chain-of-thought text content block before tool_use content blocks, even if explicitly asked to do so.\nOur testing has shown that this should not reduce performance. If you would like to keep chain-of-thought (particularly with Opus) while still requesting that the model use a specific tool, you can use {\"type\": \"auto\"} for tool_choice (the default) and add explicit instructions in a user message. For example: What's the weather like in London? Use the get_weather tool in your response.\n"

    "text": "Chain of thought\n\n\nWhen using tools, Claude will often show its \u201cchain of thought\u201d, i.e. the step-by-step reasoning it uses to break down the problem and decide which tools to use. The Claude 3 Opus model will do this if tool_choice is set to auto (this is the default value, see Forcing tool use), and Sonnet and Haiku can be prompted into doing it.\nFor example, given the prompt \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather like in San Francisco right now, and what time is it there?\u201d, Claude might respond with:\nJSON{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"<thinking>To answer this question, I will: 1.

Your code should treat the chain of thought like any other assistant-generated text, and not rely on the presence or specific formatting of the <thinking> tags.\n"

Here\u2019s an example with both a get_weather and a get_time tool, along with a user query that asks for both. Shell Python curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \\ --header \"x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \" \\ --header \"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01\" \\ --header \"content-type: application/json\" \\ --data \\ '{\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n    \"max_tokens\": 1024,\n    \"tools\": [{\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n        \"input_schema\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"location\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n                },\n                \"unit\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"],\n                    \"description\": \"The unit of temperature, either ' celsius ' or ' fahrenheit '\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"location\"]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"get_time\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the current time in a given time zone\",\n        \"input_schema\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"timezone\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"The IANA time zone name, e.g. America/Los_Angeles\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"timezone\"]\n        }\n    }],\n    \"messages\": [{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"What is the weather like right now in New York? Also what time is it there?\"\n    }]\n}' In this case, Claude will most likely try to use two separate tools, one at a time \u2014 get_weather and then get_time \u2014 in order to fully answer the user\u2019s question. However, it will also occasionally output two tool_use blocks at once, particularly if they are not dependent on each other. You would need to execute each tool and return their results in separate tool_result blocks within a single user message. Missing information If the user\u2019s prompt doesn\u2019t include enough information to fill all the required parameters for a tool, Claude 3 Opus is much more likely to recognize that a parameter is missing and ask for it. Claude 3 Sonnet may ask, especially when prompted to think before outputting a tool request. But it may also do its best to infer a reasonable value. For example, using the get_weather tool above, if you ask Claude \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather?\u201d without specifying a location, Claude, particularly Claude 3 Sonnet, may make a guess about tools inputs: JSON { \"type\" : \"tool_use\" , \"id\" : \"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9\" , \"name\" : \"get_weather\" , \"input\" : { \"location\" : \"New York, NY\" , \"unit\" : \"fahrenheit\" } } This behavior is not guaranteed, especially for more ambiguous prompts and for models less intelligent than Claude 3 Opus. If Claude 3 Opus doesn\u2019t have enough context to fill in the required parameters, it is far more likely respond with a clarifying question instead of making a tool call. Sequential tools Some tasks may require calling multiple tools in sequence, using the output of one tool as the input to another. In such a case, Claude will call one tool at a time. If prompted to call the tools all at once, Claude is likely to guess parameters for tools further downstream if they are dependent on tool results for tools further upstream. Here\u2019s an example of using a get_location tool to get the user\u2019s location, then passing that location to the get_weather tool: Shell Python curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \\ --header \"x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \" \\ --header \"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01\" \\ --header \"content-type: application/json\" \\ --data \\ '{\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n    \"max_tokens\": 1024,\n    \"tools\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_location\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current user location based on their IP address. This tool has no parameters or arguments.\",\n            \"input_schema\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {}\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n            \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n            \"input_schema\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"location\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n                    },\n                    \"unit\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"],\n                        \"description\": \"The unit of temperature, either ' celsius ' or ' fahrenheit '\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"location\"]\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"messages\": [{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"What is the weather like where I am?\"\n    }]\n}' In this case, Claude would first call the get_location tool to get the user\u2019s location. After you return the location in a tool_result , Claude would then call get_weather with that location to get the final answer. The full conversation might look like: Role Content User What\u2019s the weather like where I am? Assistant <thinking>To answer this, I first need to determine the user\u2019s location using the get_location tool. Then I can pass that location to the get_weather tool to find the current weather there.</thinking>[Tool use for get_location] User [Tool result for get_location with matching id and result of San Francisco, CA] Assistant [Tool use for get_weather with the following input]{ \u201clocation\u201d: \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d, \u201cunit\u201d: \u201cfahrenheit\u201d } User [Tool result for get_weather with matching id and result of \u201c59\u00b0F (15\u00b0C), mostly cloudy\u201d] Assistant Based on your current location in San Francisco, CA, the weather right now is 59\u00b0F (15\u00b0C) and mostly cloudy. It\u2019s a fairly cool and overcast day in the city. You may want to bring a light jacket if you\u2019re heading outside. This example demonstrates how Claude can chain together multiple tool calls to answer a question that requires gathering data from different sources. The key steps are: Claude first realizes it needs the user\u2019s location to answer the weather question, so it calls the get_location tool. The user (i.e. the client code) executes the actual get_location function and returns the result \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d in a tool_result block. With the location now known, Claude proceeds to call the get_weather tool, passing in \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d as the location parameter (as well as a guessed unit parameter, as unit is not a required parameter). The user again executes the actual get_weather function with the provided arguments and returns the weather data in another tool_result block. Finally, Claude incorporates the weather data into a natural language response to the original question. Chain of thought tool use By default, Claude 3 Opus is prompted to think before it answers a tool use query to best determine whether a tool is necessary, which tool to use, and the appropriate parameters. Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku are prompted to try to use tools as much as possible and are more likely to call an unnecessary tool or infer missing parameters. To prompt Sonnet or Haiku to better assess the user query before making tool calls, the following prompt can be used: Chain of thought prompt Answer the user's request using relevant tools (if they are available). Before calling a tool, do some analysis within \\<thinking>\\</thinking> tags. First, think about which of the provided tools is the relevant tool to answer the user's request. Second, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided. JSON mode You can use tools to get Claude produce JSON output that follows a schema, even if you don\u2019t have any intention of running that output through a tool or function. When using tools in this way: You usually want to provide a single tool You should set tool_choice (see Forcing tool use ) to instruct the model to explicitly use that tool Remember that the model will pass the input to the tool, so the name of the tool and description should be from the model\u2019s perspective.

Then I can pass that location to the get_weather tool to find the current weather there.</thinking>[Tool use for get_location]User[Tool result for get_location with matching id and result of San Francisco, CA]Assistant[Tool use for get_weather with the following input]{ \u201clocation\u201d: \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d, \u201cunit\u201d: \u201cfahrenheit\u201d }User[Tool result for get_weather with matching id and result of \u201c59\u00b0F (15\u00b0C), mostly cloudy\u201d]AssistantBased on your current location in San Francisco, CA, the weather right now is 59\u00b0F (15\u00b0C) and mostly cloudy. It\u2019s a fairly cool and overcast day in the city. You may want to bring a light jacket if you\u2019re heading outside.\nThis example demonstrates how Claude can chain together multiple tool calls to answer a question that requires gathering data from different sources. The key steps are:\nClaude first realizes it needs the user\u2019s location to answer the weather question, so it calls the get_location tool.\nThe user (i.e. the client code) executes the actual get_location function and returns the result \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d in a tool_result block.\nWith the location now known, Claude proceeds to call the get_weather tool, passing in \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d as the location parameter (as well as a guessed unit parameter, as unit is not a required parameter).\nThe user again executes the actual get_weather function with the provided arguments and returns the weather data in another tool_result block.\nFinally, Claude incorporates the weather data into a natural language response to the original question.\nChain of thought tool use By default, Claude 3 Opus is prompted to think before it answers a tool use query to best determine whether a tool is necessary, which tool to use, and the appropriate parameters. Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku are prompted to try to use tools as much as possible and are more likely to call an unnecessary tool or infer missing parameters. To prompt Sonnet or Haiku to better assess the user query before making tool calls, the following prompt can be used: Chain of thought prompt Answer the user's request using relevant tools (if they are available). Before calling a tool, do some analysis within \\<thinking>\\</thinking> tags. First, think about which of the provided tools is the relevant tool to answer the user's request. Second, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.\n\n\nChain of thought tool use\nChain of thought tool use\nBy default, Claude 3 Opus is prompted to think before it answers a tool use query to best determine whether a tool is necessary, which tool to use, and the appropriate parameters.

This is different from the large corpus of data the language model was trained on, and instead represents a \u201cworking memory\u201d for the model. A larger context window allows the model to understand and respond to more complex and lengthy prompts, while a smaller context window may limit the model\u2019s ability to handle longer prompts or maintain coherence over extended conversations.\nSee our model comparison table for a list of context window sizes by model.\n"

Our API does not currently offer fine-tuning, but please ask your Anthropic contact if you are interested in exploring this option.

These pretrained models are not inherently good at answering questions or following instructions, and often require deep skill in prompt engineering to elicit desired behaviors. Fine-tuning and RLHF are used to refine these pretrained models, making them more useful for a wide range of tasks.\n"

    "text": "RAG (Retrieval augmented generation)\n\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language model generation to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated text, and to better ground the model\u2019s response in evidence. In RAG, a language model is augmented with an external knowledge base or a set of documents that is passed into the context window. The data is retrieved at run time when a query is sent to the model, although the model itself does not necessarily retrieve the data (but can with tool use and a retrieval function). When generating text, relevant information first must be retrieved from the knowledge base based on the input prompt, and then passed to the model along with the original query. The model uses this information to guide the output it generates. This allows the model to access and utilize information beyond its training data, reducing the reliance on memorization and improving the factual accuracy of the generated text. RAG can be particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or explicit citation of sources. However, the effectiveness of RAG depends on the quality and relevance of the external knowledge base and the knowledge that is retrieved at runtime.\n"

Human feedback consists of ranking a set of two or more example texts, and the reinforcement learning process encourages the model to prefer outputs that are similar to the higher-ranked ones. Claude has been trained using RLHF to be a more helpful assistant. For more details, you can read Anthropic\u2019s paper on the subject.\n"

Higher temperatures lead to more creative and diverse outputs, allowing for multiple variations in phrasing and, in the case of fiction, variation in answers as well. Lower temperatures result in more conservative and deterministic outputs that stick to the most probable phrasing and answers. Adjusting the temperature enables users to encourage a language model to explore rare, uncommon, or surprising word choices and sequences, rather than only selecting the most likely predictions. Claude Slackbot uses a non-zero temperature when generating responses, which allows for some variation in its answers while maintaining coherence and relevance.\n"

It is an important indicator of the model\u2019s responsiveness and is particularly relevant for interactive applications, chatbots, and real-time systems where users expect quick initial feedback. A lower TTFT indicates that the model can start generating a response faster, providing a more seamless and engaging user experience.

For Claude, a token approximately represents 3.5 English characters, though the exact number can vary depending on the language used. Tokens are typically hidden when interacting with language models at the \u201ctext\u201d level but become relevant when examining the exact inputs and outputs of a language model. When Claude is provided with text to evaluate, the text (consisting of a series of characters) is encoded into a series of tokens for the model to process. Larger tokens enable data efficiency during inference and pretraining (and are utilized when possible), while smaller tokens allow a model to handle uncommon or never-before-seen words. The choice of tokenization method can impact the model\u2019s performance, vocabulary size, and ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words.\nUsing the Evaluation ToolSystem statusxlinkedin\nUsing the Evaluation ToolSystem status\nxlinkedin\nContext window Fine-tuning HHH Latency LLM Pretraining RAG (Retrieval augmented generation) RLHF Temperature TTFT (Time to first token) Tokens\nContext windowFine-tuningHHHLatencyLLMPretrainingRAG (Retrieval augmented generation)RLHFTemperatureTTFT (Time to first token)Tokens\n"

Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining. Comprehension improvements : Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents Preserves general knowledge : Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge.

Precise ticket routing allows customers to explore multi- agent approaches where one model determines the intent and then routes the ticket to a specialized virtual agent with a more defined workflow, easing the automation process.\n"

    "text": "Advantages of Using Claude\n\n\nTraditionally, multi-class classification techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been used to categorize support tickets. However, these methods require a very large training dataset, complex ontology design, and inflexible class definition.\nUsing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, text classification for customer support ticket routing has become significantly more efficient and effective, addressing the limitations of traditional ML techniques:\nMinimal training data: Claude\u2019s pre-trained language model can understand and classify tickets with just a few dozen labeled examples, greatly reducing the time and cost associated with data preparation.\nAdaptability to changing classes: As your product or customer needs evolve, Claude can easily adapt to changes in class definitions or the introduction of new classes without extensive relabeling of training data\nSimplified ontology design: Claude\u2019s advanced language understanding capabilities allow it to accurately classify tickets based on their content and context, rather than relying on strict ontological structures.\nInterpretable reasoning: Claude can generate human-readable explanations for its classification decisions, providing interpretable reasoning that builds trust in the automation system and allow you to easily adapt the approach if needed\n"

Start by investigating how your support team currently handles ticket routing. Consider questions like:\nWhat criteria are used to determine which team or department a ticket is assigned to?\nAre there any automated rules or workflows already in place? In what cases do they fail?\nHow are edge cases or ambiguous tickets handled?\nHow does the team prioritize tickets?\nThe more you know about how humans handle certain cases, the better you will be able to work with Claude to do the task.\n"

    "text": "Defining intent categories\n\n\nIntent categories are a crucial aspect of support ticket classification and routing as they represent the primary purpose or goal behind a customer\u2019s inquiry or issue. By identifying the intent category, support systems can route tickets to the most appropriate team or agent equipped to handle the specific type of request.\nIf your support team does not already have intent categories defined, you can use Claude to analyze a representative sample of tickets to identify common themes, such as product inquiries or billing questions.\nBe sure that the intent categories:\nHave descriptive names that clearly convey the primary purpose of the tickets they encompass\nAre mutually exclusive and comprehensive, leaving little ambiguity about which category a ticket belongs to\nAlign with your support team\u2019s processes and expertise to ensure tickets are routed to the agents most capable of providing effective resolutions\n"

These examples serve as a few-shot prompt to improve accuracy and consistency.\nAfter generating Claude\u2019s response, we use regular expressions to extract the reasoning and intent from the output. This allows us to separate the structured information from the generated text.\nBy crafting a clear and well-structured prompt, providing examples, and using XML tags, we can guide Claude to generate accurate and consistent classifications along with the underlying reasoning.

    "text": "Scaling to large number of intent classes\n\n\nWhile the above approach works well for a handful of classes, you might need to revisit the framing of the task if your number of Intent classes is large (e.g., in the dozens). As the number of classes grows, the list of examples will also expand, potentially making the prompt unwieldy. In such cases, consider implementing a hierarchical classification system using a mixture of classifiers.\nOne effective strategy is to organize your intents into a taxonomic tree structure. You can then create a series of classifiers at every level of the tree, enabling a cascading routing approach. For example, you might have a top-level classifier that broadly categorizes tickets into \u201cTechnical Issues,\u201d \u201cBilling Questions,\u201d and \u201cGeneral Inquiries.\u201d Each of these categories can then have its own sub-classifiers to further refine the classification.\nAn advantage of this hierarchical approach is that it closely mimics human reasoning for top-down classification. You can encode this reasoning into different prompts for each parent path, allowing for more targeted and context-specific classification. This can lead to improved accuracy and more nuanced handling of customer requests. However, the disadvantage of using multiple classifiers is the potential for slower response times due to the need for multiple calls to Claude. To mitigate this issue, consider using Haiku, the fastest model Claude offers, for the sub-classifiers. This can help strike a balance between classification accuracy and system responsiveness.\n"

We\u2019ll also focus on the predicted intent and ignore the returned reasoning for now though the reasoning will help you better understand the results.\nFor details on how to build a more robust classifier evaluation, see this classification cookbook.\nThe code snippet below evaluates Claude using three key metrics: accuracy, 95th percentile response time, and average cost per classification. By modifying the route_ticket function to return additional data, we can easily calculate these metrics and assess the model\u2019s production-readiness.\nfrom time import perf_counter\nfrom typing import Tuple\nimport anthropic\n\n# Create an instance of the Anthropic API client\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)\n\n\ndef classify_support_request(\n    request: str, gt_intent: str, model: str = DEFAULT_MODEL\n) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n    # Define the prompt for the classification task\n    classification_prompt = f\"\"\"You will be acting as a customer support ticket classification system. ... \n...\n...The reasoning should be enclosed in <reasoning> tags and the intent in <intent> tags.

We encourage referencing our Prompt Engineering guide and prompt generator for more details on how to craft the most effective prompts to optimize Claude 3\u2019s output.\nOne especially effective way to improve performance is to provide more targeted examples to Claude in the prompt. To do so, you could employ a vector database to do similarity searches from a sample dataset and retrieve the most relevant examples for a given query. By augmenting the LLM with retrieved examples, we can provide additional context and improve the accuracy of the generated classifications. This approach is outlined in this classification cookbook, which walks through how this approach improved performance from 71% accuracy to 93% accuracy.\n"

    "text": "Adapting to common scenarios\n\n\nIn addition to this approach, performance can often be meaningfully improved by providing more edge case examples to Claude in the prompt.  Here are some scenarios where Claude may misclassify tickets and it would be valuable to consider including examples of how to handle in the prompt:\nImplicit Requests: Customers often express needs indirectly. For example, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now.\u201d is an indirect request for order status.\nEmotional Prioritization: When customers express dissatisfaction, Claude may prioritize addressing the emotion over solving the underlying problem. Providing Claude with directions on when to prioritize customer sentiment or not can be helpful.\nIntent vs. Routing: Claude may correctly identify a customer intent, but route it incorrectly. Clarifying the appropriate routes of certain intents is important, especially when the routes may be more ambiguous.\nIssue Prioritization: When customers present multiple issues in a single interaction, Claude may have difficulty identifying the primary concern. Clarifying the prioritization of intents can help Claude better identify the primary concern.\nRemember, as your system evolves, it\u2019s essential to regularly review and refine your prompts to ensure they remain effective and aligned with your changing needs. Continuously monitor the system\u2019s performance, gather feedback from stakeholders, and make necessary adjustments to optimize its accuracy and efficiency.\n"

    "chunk_heading": "Integrate Claude into your Support Workflow",
    "text": "Integrate Claude into your Support Workflow\n\n\nWhen integrating your code into production, you\u2019ll need to architect how it fits into the flow of your ticket routing system. There are two ways you could go around doing this:\nPush-based: Where the Support Ticket System you\u2019re using (e.g. Zendesk an Anthropic partner) will trigger your code by sending a webhook event to your routing service, which will then classify the intent and route it.\nPull-Based: Where your code could pull for the latest tickets at a certain schedule and then route them.\nWhile the bulk of the classification work discussed in previous sections remains the same, you will need to wrap your code in a service for either of the two approaches above. The choice of approach depends on what APIs the support ticketing system provides. Between the two, the push-based approach using webhooks is more web-scaleable but needs you to expose a public endpoint that might have IT Security implications. The pull-based approach is easier to implement but makes unnecessary calls to the Support Ticket System.\n\nThe diagram above shows the push-based approach in action:\nSupport Ticket Creation - The process begins when a customer creates a new support ticket. The customer provides the necessary information about their issue or inquiry, which is then submitted to the Support Ticket System.\nWebhook Event Generation - Upon receiving the new support ticket, the Support Ticket System should generate a Webhook Event Ticket Created notification. This event triggers the subsequent steps in the ticket routing process.\nTicket Content Retrieval - The webhook event initiates the retrieval of the ticket\u2019s contents from the Support Ticket System. This step ensures that the full details of the customer\u2019s issue are available for analysis and classification.\nSupport Request Classification - Using the retrieved ticket contents, the system classifies the intent behind the support request using your code. This classification helps identify the most appropriate team or service to handle the ticket. For the webhook-based approach to work, your code from the previous section will need to be served using a RESTful API which can be called from the webhook. The endpoint for the request would need to be reachable from the internet.\nTicket Update - Finally, the ticket is updated back into the Support Ticket System, from where the assigned support team can work on resolving it.\nNote: While the classification method calls Claude API, we\u2019ve removed that extra call from the diagram for simplicity.\n"

    "chunk_heading": "Additional Considerations",
    "text": "Additional Considerations\n\n\nBefore fully deploying to production, consider the following steps to ensure a smooth and reliable rollout of your solutions:\nImplement retry logic: While Claude is a robust and highly available assistant, it\u2019s crucial to add try/except logic to handle cases where Claude doesn\u2019t return the expected formatted output or is temporarily unavailable. Implement back-off logic to retry after increasing intervals or slightly adjust the temperature to generate output variations.\nThorough staging testing: Conduct extensive testing in a staging environment that closely resembles your production setup. This will help identify any potential issues or incompatibilities before deployment.\nLoad testing: Perform load testing to verify that the system can handle the anticipated volume of tickets without performance degradation. This ensures that the system remains responsive and efficient under real-world conditions.\nError handling and logging: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to facilitate debugging and monitoring in production. This will help you quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.\nGradual rollout: Establish a phased rollout plan, starting with a small percentage of traffic and gradually increasing it while closely monitoring the system\u2019s behavior. This approach minimizes risk and allows for a controlled deployment.\nDocumentation and training: Prepare detailed documentation and provide training to relevant stakeholders on how to use and maintain the new system effectively. This ensures a smooth transition and promotes adoption.\nMonitoring and alerting: Set up robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect and address any issues that may arise in production. This enables your team to respond quickly and minimize downtime.\nBy following these steps, you can ensure a successful and reliable deployment of your automated ticket routing system, providing a seamless experience for your users.\nClassificationModelsxlinkedin\nClassificationModels\nxlinkedin\nIntroduction Benefits of Automated Ticket Routing Advantages of Using Claude Defining the Task Defining intent categories Example Data Prompting Claude for Ticket Routing Scaling to large number of intent classes Evaluating the Performance of your Ticket Routing Classifier Choosing the right model Evaluation Methodology Iterating your prompt for better performance Adapting to common scenarios Integrate Claude into your Support Workflow Additional Considerations\nIntroductionBenefits of Automated Ticket RoutingAdvantages of Using ClaudeDefining the TaskDefining intent categoriesExample DataPrompting Claude for Ticket RoutingScaling to large number of intent classesEvaluating the Performance of your Ticket Routing ClassifierChoosing the right modelEvaluation MethodologyIterating your prompt for better performanceAdapting to common scenariosIntegrate Claude into your Support WorkflowAdditional Considerations\n"

It provides a general idea of the model\u2019s speed.\nTime to first token (TTFT): This metric measures the time it takes for the model to generate the first token of the response, from when the prompt was sent. It\u2019s particularly relevant when you\u2019re using streaming (more on that later) and want to provide a responsive experience to your users.\nFor a more in-depth understanding of these terms, check out our glossary.\n"

    "text": "2. Optimize prompt and output length\n\n\nMinimize the number of tokens in both your input prompt and the expected output, while still maintaining high performance. The fewer tokens the model has to process and generate, the faster the response will be.\nHere are some tips to help you optimize your prompts and outputs:\nBe clear but concise: Aim to convey your intent clearly and concisely in the prompt. Avoid unnecessary details or redundant information, while keeping in mind that claude lacks context on your use case and may not make the intended leaps of logic if instructions are unclear.\nAsk for shorter responses:: Ask Claude directly to be concise. The Claude 3 family of models has improved steerability over previous generations. If Claude is outputting unwanted length, ask Claude to curb its chattiness.\n Due to how LLMs count tokens instead of words, asking for an exact word count or a word count limit is not as effective a strategy as asking for paragraph or sentence count limits.\nSet appropriate output limits: Use the max_tokens parameter to set a hard limit on the maximum length of the generated response. This prevents Claude from generating overly long outputs.\n\nNote: When the response reaches max_tokens tokens, the response will be cut off, perhaps midsentence or mid-word, so this is a blunt technique that may require post-processing and is usually most appropriate for multiple choice or short answer responses where the answer comes right at the beginning.\n\n\nExperiment with temperature: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the output. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) can sometimes lead to more focused and shorter responses, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) may result in more diverse but potentially longer outputs.\nDue to how LLMs count tokens instead of words, asking for an exact word count or a word count limit is not as effective a strategy as asking for paragraph or sentence count limits.\nDue to how LLMs count tokens instead of words, asking for an exact word count or a word count limit is not as effective a strategy as asking for paragraph or sentence count limits.\n\nDue to how LLMs count tokens instead of words, asking for an exact word count or a word count limit is not as effective a strategy as asking for paragraph or sentence count limits.\nNote: When the response reaches max_tokens tokens, the response will be cut off, perhaps midsentence or mid-word, so this is a blunt technique that may require post-processing and is usually most appropriate for multiple choice or short answer responses where the answer comes right at the beginning.\nFinding the right balance between prompt clarity, output quality, and token count may require some experimentation.\n"

    "text": "Examples\n\n\nExample: Financial analysis without thinking Without step-by-step thinking, Claude gives a recommendation that seems reasonable but lacks depth. It doesn\u2019t quantify the potential outcomes or consider historical market performance, which are crucial for making an informed decision. Role Content User You\u2019re a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Assistant Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here\u2019s why: 1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years). 2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there\u2019s a downturn close to when they need the funds. 3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there\u2019s less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility. While the stock\u2019s historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it\u2019s time to make the down payment. Example: Financial analysis with thinking With step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis. It calculates exact figures for both scenarios, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client\u2019s risk tolerance. This thorough reasoning leads to a more confident and justifiable recommendation. Role Content User You\u2019re a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step. Assistant To determine the best investment option for our client, I\u2019ll consider several factors step-by-step: <thinking> 1. Understand the client\u2019s goal and timeline: - Goal: Down payment for a house - Timeline: 5 years - Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility. 2. Analyze Option A (Stock): - Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually) - Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses) - Calculate potential 5-year return: - Best case (12% annually): $10,000 * (1.12)^5 \u2248 $17,623.42 - Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = $5,000 3.

It doesn\u2019t quantify the potential outcomes or consider historical market performance, which are crucial for making an informed decision. Role Content User You\u2019re a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Assistant Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here\u2019s why: 1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years). 2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there\u2019s a downturn close to when they need the funds. 3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there\u2019s less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility. While the stock\u2019s historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it\u2019s time to make the down payment.\n\n\nExample: Financial analysis without thinking\nExample: Financial analysis without thinking\nWithout step-by-step thinking, Claude gives a recommendation that seems reasonable but lacks depth.

However, our SMB segment saw a slight decline of 5%, which we aim to address through targeted marketing initiatives in Q3. 2. Profit Margins: Gross margin improved to 72% (up 3% from Q1) due to infrastructure optimizations. EBITDA margin, however, dipped to 18% (down 2%) as we invested heavily in R&D for our upcoming AI-driven features. 3. Cash Flow: Operating cash flow remains strong at $4.1M. Our cash reserves stand at $28M, providing a 15-month runway at current burn rate. We did see a 20% increase in customer acquisition costs, which we\u2019re addressing through more efficient sales strategies. In summary, AcmeCorp\u2019s core financials remain robust.

Example: Legal contract analysis Without XML tags, Claude\u2019s analysis is disorganized and misses key points. With tags, it provides a structured, thorough analysis that a legal team can act on. Role No XML Tags With XML Tags User Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks and liabilities: {{CONTRACT}}. Focus on indemnification, limitation of liability, and IP ownership clauses. Also, note any unusual or concerning terms. Here\u2019s our standard contract for reference: {{STANDARD_CONTRACT}}. Give a summary of findings and recommendations for our legal team. Analyze this software licensing agreement for legal risks and liabilities. We\u2019re a multinational enterprise considering this agreement for our core data infrastructure. <agreement> {{CONTRACT}}</agreement> This is our standard contract for reference: <standard_contract>{{STANDARD_CONTRACT}}</standard_contract> <instructions> 1. Analyze these clauses: - Indemnification - Limitation of liability - IP ownership 2. Note unusual or concerning terms. 3. Compare to our standard contract. 4. Summarize findings in <findings> tags. 5. List actionable recommendations in <recommendations> tags.</instructions> Assistant The provided software licensing agreement presents several concerning aspects. The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create. In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors. <findings> 1. Indemnification (Clause 8): - Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against \u201cany and all claims\u201d arising from our use. - Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor\u2019s negligence or product defects. - Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement. 2. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9): - Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages. - Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use. A critical failure could cost millions. - Deviation: Our standard allows for direct damages up to 12 months of fees paid. 3. IP Ownership (Clause 12): - Issue: Grants vendor joint ownership of our modifications/integrations. - Risk: Vendor could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights. - Deviation: Our standard retains full ownership of our work. 4. Unusual Terms: - Clause 5.3: Vendor can use our usage data for \u201cany purpose.\u201d - Clause 7.2: Vendor can terminate for \u201cconvenience\u201d with only 7 days\u2019 notice. - Clause 11: No warranties of any kind, even for basic merchantability. </findings> <recommendations> 1. Reject this agreement. Risks far outweigh benefits for an enterprise. 2. Counter-propose: - Indemnification: Limit to claims arising from our violation of agreement. - Liability: Cap at 12 months\u2019 fees for direct damages; negotiate for indirect. - IP: Full ownership of our modifications/integrations. - Data Use: Restrict to service improvement only. - Termination: Minimum 90 days\u2019 notice; only for cause. - Warranties: Demand basic merchantability and fitness for purpose. 3. If vendor refuses, explore alternative providers or in-house solutions. 4. Engage legal counsel for contract negotiation given high stakes. </recommendations>\nExample: Generating financial reports Without XML tags, Claude misunderstands the task and generates a report that doesn\u2019t match the required structure or tone.

Revenue Growth:Our Q2 revenue reached $15.2M, a 22% YoY increase. This growth is primarily driven by a 30% expansion in our enterprise client base. However, our SMB segment saw a slight decline of 5%, which we aim to address through targeted marketing initiatives in Q3.2. Profit Margins:Gross margin improved to 72% (up 3% from Q1) due to infrastructure optimizations. EBITDA margin, however, dipped to 18% (down 2%) as we invested heavily in R&D for our upcoming AI-driven features.3. Cash Flow:Operating cash flow remains strong at $4.1M. Our cash reserves stand at $28M, providing a 15-month runway at current burn rate. We did see a 20% increase in customer acquisition costs, which we\u2019re addressing through more efficient sales strategies.In summary, AcmeCorp\u2019s core financials remain robust.

The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities.

Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create. In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest.

Limitation of Liability (Clause 9): - Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages. - Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use.

Assistant {{ANALYSIS}} 1. Scalability: + Database sharding by tenant reduces contention, supports high growth. + Microservices allow independent scaling of components. - Shared app servers could bottleneck under extreme load. - No mention of auto-scaling or load balancing for app tier. 2. Security: + Tenant data isolation via sharding mitigates data leaks. + JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens is industry best practice. - No mention of encryption (at rest, in transit) or key management. - IAM strategy lacks detail on roles, permissions, or RBAC. 3. Cost-effectiveness: + Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs. + Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs. - Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB. - No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving. Prompt 2 Role Content User Draft a strategy review document for engineering leadership based on this analysis of a multitenancy strategy. <strategy> {{STRATEGY}} </strategy> <analysis> {{ANALYSIS}} </analysis> Include an executive summary, detailed analysis, and recommendations. Assistant {{STRATEGY_DOC}} # Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product ## Executive Summary The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions. ## Detailed Analysis ### 1. Scalability: B+ Strengths: - Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling. - Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads. Weaknesses: - Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants. - Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning. ### 2. Security: B- Strengths: - Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants. - JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows. Weaknesses: - No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data. - Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated? - IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC). ### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B Strengths: - Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic. - Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used. Weaknesses: - Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning. - No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks. - Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs. ## Recommendations 1. App Tier Resilience : Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets. 2. Security Hardening : a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management. c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO. 3. Cost Optimization : a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale. b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads. c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning. 4. Proof of Concept (PoC) : Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation: a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance. b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes. c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls. With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients.

It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.## Detailed Analysis### 1. Scalability: B+Strengths:- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.Weaknesses:- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.### 2. Security: B-Strengths:- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.Weaknesses:- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).### 3. Cost-effectiveness: BStrengths:- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.Weaknesses:- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.## Recommendations1. App Tier Resilience: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.2. Security Hardening:   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.3. Cost Optimization:   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.4. Proof of Concept (PoC): Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients.\nPrompt 3\nRoleContentUserGrade this strategy review document for clarity, actionability, and alignment with enterprise priorities. <priorities>{{PRIORITIES}}</priorities><strategy_doc>{{STRATEGY_DOC}}</strategy_doc>Assistant1.

As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an input key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple content_block_delta events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.\n"
