Sublessee shall exercise this option by giving Sublessor written notice of its intent to do so no later than nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term.

3. RENT

3.1 Base Rent for Initial Term: Commencing on the Commencement Date and continuing throughout the Initial Term, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor as base rent for the Subleased Premises the sum of Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) per month ("Base Rent").

3.2 Base Rent for Extension Term: If Sublessee exercises its option to extend the Term as provided in Section 2.2, the Base Rent for the Extension Term shall be the greater of (i) the Base Rent in effect immediately prior to the commencement of the Extension Term, increased by three percent (3%) per annum, compounded annually, or (ii) the then-prevailing fair market rental rate for comparable space in the building and surrounding area, as mutually agreed upon by Sublessor and Sublessee.

3.4 Late Charges: If any installment of Base Rent or additional rent is not received by Sublessor within five (5) days after the date when due, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue amount to cover the extra expense involved in handling delinquent payments. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Sublessor will incur by reason of late payment by Sublessee.

4. SECURITY DEPOSIT

4.1 Amount: Upon execution of this Sublease, Sublessee shall deposit with Sublessor the sum of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($225,000.00) as a security deposit (the "Security Deposit") to secure Sublessee's faithful performance of all terms, covenants, and conditions of this Sublease.

If Sublessor uses any portion of the Security Deposit, Sublessee shall, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. Provided that Sublessee has fully and faithfully performed all of its obligations under this Sublease, Sublessor shall return the Security Deposit, or any balance thereof, to Sublessee within thirty (30) days after the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease.

2.3 Option to Extend: Provided that Sublessee is not in default under any of the terms and conditions of this Sublease, Sublessee shall have two (2) options to extend the term of this Sublease for additional periods of three (3) years each (each, an "Extension Term") upon the same terms and conditions contained in this Sublease, except that the Base Rent during each Extension Term shall be as set forth in Section 3.2 below.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. SUBLEASED PREMISES

The Subleased Premises are more particularly described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

1.2 Common Areas: Sublessee shall have the non-exclusive right to use, in common with Sublessor and other tenants or occupants of the Master Premises, the common areas of the building, including but not limited to lobbies, elevators, stairways, parking facilities, and other common facilities, subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease and any rules and regulations promulgated by the Master Lessor or Sublessor.

2. TERM

2.1 Initial Term: The initial term of this Sublease shall commence on December 1, 2023 (the "Commencement Date") and shall expire on November 30, 2029 (the "Expiration Date"), unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Sublease or the Master Lease (the "Initial Term").

2.2 Early Access: Sublessee shall have the right to access the Subleased Premises thirty (30) days prior to the Commencement Date for the purpose of installing Sublessee's furniture, fixtures, equipment, and laboratory systems, provided that such early access does not interfere with Sublessor's operations or any work being performed by Sublessor in the Subleased Premises. Such early access shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this Sublease, except for the obligation to pay rent.

2.3 Option to Extend: Provided that Sublessee is not in default under any of the terms and conditions of this Sublease, Sublessee shall have one (1) option to extend the term of this Sublease for an additional period of five (5) years (the "Extension Term") upon the same terms and conditions contained in this Sublease, except that the Base Rent during the Extension Term shall be as set forth in Section 3.2 below. Sublessee shall exercise this option by giving Sublessor written notice of its intent to do so no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term.

3. RENT

Year 1: $262,500.00 per month

Year 3: $278,486.25 per month
Year 4: $286,840.84 per month
Year 5: $295,446.06 per month

Base Rent shall be payable in advance on or before the first day of each calendar month during the Term, without notice, demand, deduction, or offset.

3.2 Base Rent for Extension Term: If Sublessee exercises its option to extend the Term as provided in Section 2.3, the Base Rent for the Extension Term shall be the greater of (i) the Base Rent in effect immediately prior to the commencement of the Extension Term, increased by three and a half percent (3.5%) per annum, compounded annually, or (ii) the then-prevailing fair market rental rate for comparable office, laboratory, and research space in the building and surrounding area, as mutually agreed upon by Sublessor and Sublessee. If Sublessor and Sublessee are unable to agree upon the fair market rental rate within sixty (60) days after Sublessee's exercise of the extension option, the fair market rental rate shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto.

3.3 Additional Rent: In addition to the Base Rent, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor as additional rent Sublessee's Proportionate Share (as defined below) of Operating Expenses (as defined in the Master Lease) for the Master Premises. Sublessee's Proportionate Share shall be thirty-five percent (35%), which is the percentage obtained by dividing the rentable square footage of the Subleased Premises (35,000 sq. ft.) by the rentable square footage of the Master Premises (100,000 sq. ft.).

The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Sublessor will incur by reason of late payment by Sublessee.

4. SECURITY DEPOSIT

4.1 Amount: Upon execution of this Sublease, Sublessee shall deposit with Sublessor the sum of Seven Hundred Eighty-Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($787,500.00) as a security deposit (the "Security Deposit") to secure Sublessee's faithful performance of all terms, covenants, and conditions of this Sublease.
