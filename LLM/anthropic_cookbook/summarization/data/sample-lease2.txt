If any portion of the Security Deposit is so used, applied, or retained, Subtenant shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of written demand from Sublandlord, restore the Security Deposit to its original amount.

ARTICLE 8

ASSIGNMENT, SUBLETTING & ENCUMBRANCE

8.1 Consent Required. Subtenant shall not assign this Sublease or any interest therein nor shall Subtenant sublet, license, encumber or permit the Subleased Premises or any part thereof to be used or occupied by others, without Sublandlord’s and Master Landlord’s prior written consent. Sublandlord’s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld provided, however, Sublandlord’s withholding of consent shall in all events be deemed reasonable if for any reason Master Landlord’s consent is not obtained. The consent by Sublandlord and Master Landlord to any assignment or subletting shall not waive the need for Subtenant (and Subtenant’s assignee or subtenant) to obtain the consent of Sublandlord and Master Landlord to any different or further assignment or subletting. All conditions and standards set forth in the Master Lease regarding assignments and subletting shall apply, and to the extent there are any Bonus Rents, (Rent paid by such Assignee or SubSubtenant in excess of Rent paid by Subtenant hereunder) subtenant shall provide the Master Landlord with the amounts it is entitled to under the Master Lease.

8.2 Form of Document. Every assignment, agreement, or sublease shall (i) recite that it is and shall be subject and subordinate to the provisions of this Sublease, that the assignee or subtenant assumes Subtenant’s obligation hereunder, that the termination of this Sublease shall at Sublandlord’s sole election, constitute a termination of every such assignment or sublease, and (ii) contain such other terms and conditions customary for a sub-sublease of this type as shall be reasonably requested or provided by Sublandlord’s attorneys.

8.3 No Release of Subtenant. Regardless of Sublandlord’s consent, no subletting or assignment shall release Subtenant of Subtenant’s obligation or alter the primary liability of Subtenant to pay the Rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Subtenant hereunder except to the extent that Sublandlord and Master Landlord consent to such release in writing. The acceptance of Rent by Sublandlord from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Sublandlord of any provision hereof. In the event of default by any assignee, subtenant or any other successor of Subtenant, in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Sublandlord may proceed directly against Subtenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such assignee, subtenant or successor.

8.4 Default. An involuntary assignment shall constitute a default and Sublandlord shall have the right to elect to terminate this Sublease, in which case this Sublease shall not be treated as an asset of Subtenant.

ARTICLE 9

DEFAULT

9.1 Default Described. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a material breach of this Sublease and a default by Subtenant: (i) failure to pay Rent or any other amount within three (3) days after notice the same is past due; (ii) all those items of default set forth in the Master Lease where the obligation is incorporated in this Sublease which remain uncured after the cure period provided in the Master Lease; or (iii) Subtenant’s failure to perform timely and remain uncured after fifteen (15) days written notice of the default, any other material provision of this Sublease.

 

7

9.2 Sublandlord’s Remedies. Sublandlord shall have the remedies set forth in the Master Lease as if Sublandlord is Master Landlord in the event of a default by Subtenant of any obligation of Sublandlord assumed by Subtenant under this Sublease that constitutes a default under Section 19 of the Master Lease. These remedies are not exclusive; they are cumulative and in addition to any remedies now or later allowed by law.

9.3 Subtenant’s Right to Possession Not Terminated. Sublandlord has the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (lessor may continue lease in effect after. lessee’s breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due, if lessee has right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations). Sublandlord may continue this Sublease in full force and effect, and Sublandlord shall have the right to collect rent and other sums when due. During the period Subtenant is in default, Sublandlord may enter the Subleased Premises and relet them, or any part of them, to third parties for Subtenant’s account and alter or install locks and other security devices at the Subleased Premises. Subtenant shall be liable immediately to Sublandlord for all costs Sublandlord incurs in reletting the Subleased Premises, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, brokers’ commissions, expenses of remodeling the Subleased Premises required by the reletting, and like costs. Reletting may be for a period equal to, shorter or longer than the remaining term of this Sublease and rent received by Sublandlord shall be applied to (i) first, any indebtedness from Subtenant to Sublandlord other than rent due from Subtenant; (ii) second, all costs incurred by Sublandlord in reletting, including, without limitation, brokers’ fees or commissions and attorneys fees, the cost of removing and storing the property of Subtenant or any other occupant, and the costs of repairing, altering, maintaining, remodeling or otherwise putting the Subleased Premises into condition acceptable to a new Subtenant or Subtenants; (iii) third, rent due and unpaid under this Sublease. After deducting the payments referred to in this subsection 9.3, any sum remaining from the rent Sublandlord receives from reletting shall be held by Sublandlord and applied in payment of future rent and other amounts as rent and such amounts become due under this Sublease. In no event shall Subtenant be entitled to any excess rent received by Sublandlord.

9.4 All Sums Due and Payable as Rent. Subtenant shall also pay without notice, or where notice is required under this Sublease, immediately upon demand without any abatement, deduction, or setoff, as additional rent all sums, impositions, costs, expenses, and other payments which Subtenant in any of the provisions of this Sublease assumes or agrees to pay, and, in case of any nonpayment thereof, Sublandlord shall have all the rights and remedies provided for in this Sublease or by law in the case of nonpayment of rent.

9.5 No Waiver. Sublandlord may accept Subtenant’s payments without waiving any rights under the Sublease, including rights under a previously served notice of default. No payment by Subtenant or receipt by Sublandlord of a lesser amount than any installment of rent due or other sums shall be deemed as other than a payment on account of the amount due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction; and Sublandlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice of Sublandlord’s right to recover the balance of such Rent or other sum or pursue any other remedy provided in this Sublease, at law or in equity. If Sublandlord accepts payments

 

8

after serving a notice of default, Sublandlord may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Subtenant any further notice or demand. Furthermore, Sublandlord’s acceptance of Rent from Subtenant when the Subtenant is holding over without express written consent does not convert Subtenant’s tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month-to-month tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Sublease shall be implied by any failure of Sublandlord to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision, even if that violation continues or is repeated. Any waiver by Sublandlord or Subtenant of any provision of this Sublease must be in writing. Such waiver shall affect only the provisions specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Sublandlord or Subtenant shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof. No act or conduct of Sublandlord, including, without limitation the acceptance of keys to the Subleased Premises shall constitute acceptance or the surrender of the Subleased Premises by Subtenant before the Expiration Date. Only written notice from Sublandlord to Subtenant of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance or surrender of the Subleased Premises. Sublandlord’s consent to or approval of any act by Subtenant which requires Sublandlord’s consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary Sublandlord’s consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Subtenant.

9.6 Sublandlord Default. For purposes of this Sublease, Sublandlord shall not be deemed in default hereunder unless and until Subtenant shall first deliver to Sublandlord thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, and Sublandlord shall fail to cure said default within said thirty (30) day period, or in the event Sublandlord shall reasonably require in excess of thirty (30) days to cure said default, shall fail to commence said cure with said thirty (30) day period, and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion. If Sublandlord (a) does not commence performance within such thirty (30) calendar day period, or (b) fails to diligently commence and pursue such performance to completion, and the effect of such failure associated with such non-performance materially interferes with Subtenant’s use of the Subleased Premises, Subtenant may perform Sublandlord’s obligation, at Sublandlord’s expense (if the cost of such performance obligations are included in Base Rent), and Sublandlord shall reimburse Subtenant within thirty (30) days of Subtenant’s delivery to Sublandlord of written proof that such performance costs have been paid by Subtenant.

9.7 Notice of Event of Default under Master Lease. Sublandlord shall notify Subtenant of any Event of Default under the Master Lease, or of any other event of which Sublandlord has actual knowledge which will impair Subtenant’s ability to conduct its normal business at the Subleased Premises, as soon as reasonably practicable following Sublandlord’s receipt of notice from Master Landlord of an Event of Default or Sublandlord’s actual knowledge of such impairment.

9.8 No Default of Master Lease. Sublandlord will not voluntarily do, or fail to do, anything which will constitute a default under the Master Lease or permit the Master Lease to be terminated for any reason. Sublandlord hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Subtenant from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) arising from Sublandlord’s breach of any provisions of this Sublease, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 9.8. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease.

For the purposes of this indemnity provision, any acts or omissions of Subtenant or by employees, agents, assignees, contractors or subcontractors of Subtenant (whether or not they are negligent, intentional or unlawful) shall be strictly attributable to Subtenant.
