Exhibit 10.32

SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT (“Sublease”), is dated as of April 1, 2006, by and between COHEN BROTHERS, LLC d/b/a COHEN & COMPANY (“Sublessor”) and TABERNA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC (“Sublessee”), collectively, the “Parties” and each a “Party”.

WHEREAS, Sublessor is the lessee under a written lease agreement dated June 22, 2005 wherein Brandywine Cira, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Lessor”), leased Suite No. 1703 which contains 13,777 rentable square feet per ansi/Boma 1996 measurements standards constituting a portion of the 17th Floor in the building commonly known as Cira Center located at 2929 Arch Street in the City of Philadelphia, County of Philadelphia, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, (“Master Premises”). Said lease is referred to as the “Master Lease” and is attached hereto as Exhibit “A”. Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Master Lease.

WHERAS, Sublessor desires to lease to Sublessee and Sublessee desires to rent from Sublessor a portion of the Master Premises, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the rents, covenants and provisions contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Sublessor and Sublessee, each intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1. PREMISES. (a) Sublessor hereby subleases to Sublessee, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Sublease, a portion of the Master Premises, as more fully set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto (the “Premises”). (b) Sublessee has examined the Premises and is satisfied with its condition. The Parties agree that Sublessor has not made and Sublessee is not relying upon, any statements or representations made by Sublessor or Lessor, or their respective employees, agents or anyone else acting on behalf of Sublessor or Lessor (as applicable), including without limitation, any statements or representations concerning the condition of the Premises or the fitness of the Premises for Sublessee’s intended use of the Premises. Sublessee acknowledges that it takes the Premises in an “AS IS, WHERE IS” condition. 

2. TERM. (a) This Sublease shall commence on April 1, 2024 (“Commencement Date”) for a term (“Term”) of five (5) years. (b) Upon expiration of the Term, if Sublessor shall renew the Master Lease, the Parties may renew this Sublease on similar terms as the Parties may agree. 

3. RENT. (a) During the Term, Sublessee agrees to pay Sublessor monthly rent in the amount set forth on Exhibit “B” attached hereto (“Fixed Rent,” and together with all additional rent payable under this Sublease, “Rent”). (b) Sublessee shall pay as additional rent, its pro rata share (based on the square footage rented by Sublessee) of Sublessor’s Allocated Share of Recognized Expenses as set forth in Section 6 of the Master Lease. (c) All Rent due under this Sublease shall be paid in lawful money of the United States without notice, offset or demand, with the first payment being delivered by Sublessee to Sublessor on the Commencement Date and payments to be made thereafter on the first day of each calendar month during the Term by the Sublessee to Sublessor at the address set forth for Sublessor in Section 16 below, or at such other place as Sublessor may from time to time designate. Any Rent for any partial month at the beginning or end of the Term shall be prorated based on the actual number of days in the month in question. (d) If any payment required by Sublessee under any of the terms hereof shall not be paid within five (5) days of the date on which said payment is due, Sublessee shall, upon demand, pay a late charge to Sublessor equal to the greater of (a) One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00), or (b) $0.06 for each dollar so due and such late charge shall be deemed to be additional rent for the purposes of this Sublease. This remedy shall not be the exclusive remedy to Lessor. 

4. USE OF PREMISES. Sublessee shall not use or occupy or permit the Premises to be used or occupied, nor do or permit anything to be done in or on the Premises, in whole or in part, in a manner which would in any way violate any term or condition of this Sublease or the Master Lease, or make void or voidable any insurance then in force with respect thereto, or as will cause or be likely to cause injury to any improvements on the Premises or any part thereof, or as will constitute a public or private nuisance, and shall not use or occupy or permit the Premises to be used or occupied, in whole or in part, in a manner which may violate any present or future laws, regulations, ordinances or requirements of any federal, state or local governments, or of any departments, subdivisions, bureaus or offices thereof, or any other government, public or quasi-public authorities now existing or hereafter created, having jurisdiction over the Premises. 

5. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease or further sublet all or any part of the Premises, without Sublessor’s prior written consent, such consent to be withheld in Sublessor’s sole and absolute discretion.

6. INDEMNIFICATION. Sublessee hereby indemnifies Sublessor and Lessor and covenants and agrees to pay, defend and save Sublessor and Lessor harmless from and against any and all liability, loss, damage, cost, expense (including, without limitation, all attorney’s fees and costs of litigation), causes of action, suits, claims, demands or judgments of any nature whatsoever that arises from Sublessee’s actions or omissions and which is based upon, arising from or connected in any manner with (a) injury to or death of any person or damage to any property occurring on the Premises, (b) the use, non-use, possession, operation, maintenance, management or occupation of the Premises or any part thereof, (c) any negligence on the part of Sublessee or its agents, contractors, servants, employees, licenses or invitees, or (d) the violation by Sublessee of any term, condition or covenant of this Sublease or the Master Lease (to the extent incorporated herein) or of any contract, agreement, restriction or regulation affecting the Premises or any part thereof or the ownership, occupancy or use thereof. The obligations of Sublessee under this Section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Sublease. 

7. HOLDOVER RENT. Upon expiration or other termination of this Sublease, Sublessee shall peaceably quit and surrender the Premises to Sublessor, and Sublessor may without further notice enter upon, possess and repossess itself thereof and hold and enjoy the Premises and the right to receive all rental and other income of and from the same. It is expressly agreed that any holding, continued use or occupancy of the Premises by Sublessee after the expiration or other termination of this Sublease shall operate and be construed as a tenancy at sufferance. If Sublessor shall not give consent to such holdover to Sublessee, such tenancy may be terminated as above provided, and until Sublessee has vacated the Premises, it agrees to pay to Sublessor rent at a monthly rental equal to twice the amount of the monthly Rent payable pursuant to this Sublease during the last full month before termination of this Sublease and Sublessee agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Sublessor harmless of, from and against all liability arising under the Master Lease arising from such holdover. 

8. INSURANCE. (a) Throughout the Term, Sublessee agrees to maintain all insurance as required on the part of the Tenant under the Master Lease, and shall name as additional insureds, as their interests may appear, both the Lessor and Sublessor. (b) Upon execution and delivery of this Sublease and thereafter not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the policies maintained pursuant to this Section, Sublessee shall provide Sublessor with evidence of coverage and payment in the form of a Certificate of Insurance (“Certificate”). Said Certificate shall provide for a fifteen (15) day written notice to Sublessor and Lessor in the event of cancellation or modification. 

9. OTHER PROVISIONS OF SUBLEASE. Except to the extent made inapplicable or otherwise modified by the terms of this Sublease, all terms and conditions of the Master Lease are incorporated into and made a part of this Sublease as if Sublessor were the lessor thereunder, (it being understood that Sublessor’s obligation and ability to perform obligations of the Lessor incorporated herein under the Master

Lease may be dependant upon the approval of and/or performance by Lessor, over which Sublessor has no control). Sublessee assumes and agrees to perform the lessee’s obligations under the Master Lease during the Term to the extent that such obligations are applicable to the Premises. Sublessee shall not commit or suffer any act or omission that will violate any of the provisions of the Master Lease. If the Master Lease terminates, this Sublease shall terminate and the parties shall be relieved of any further liability or obligation under this Sublease provided however, that if the Master Lease terminates as a result of a default or breach by Sublessor or Sublessee under this Sublease and/or the Master Lease, then the defaulting party shall be liable to the non-defaulting party for all damages suffered as a result of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Master Lease gives Sublessor any right to terminate the Master Lease in the event of the partial or total damage, destruction, or condemnation of the Master Premises or the building or project of which the Master Premises are a part, the exercise of such right by Sublessor shall not constitute a default or breach hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained herein and provided that Sublessee is not in default under the terms and conditions of this Sublease, Sublessor agrees not to terminate the Master Lease or do any act (or refrain from doing any act) that would lead to the Master Lease being terminated prior to the end of the term of this Sublease, without the prior written consent of Sublessee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

10. DEFAULT; REMEDIES. An “Event of Default” shall be deemed to occur under this Sublease in the event:
 (a) Sublessee fails to pay any Rent specified in this Sublease at the time or place when due; 
 (b) Sublessee shall desert or vacate the Premises; 
 (c) the Sublessee shall fail to comply with any term, provision, condition or covenant of this Sublease or of the Master Lease (other than the payment of Rent required to be paid under this Sublease), and Sublessee shall not cure such default within ten (10) calendar days after notice to Sublessee of Sublessee’s failure so to comply or such longer period as may be necessary to cure any non-monetary default proceeding continuously and diligently, except Sublessee’s failure to maintain insurance as required hereunder shall be an immediate Event of Default hereunder; 
 (d) any petition shall be filed by or against Sublessee under any section or chapter of the Federal or State Bankruptcy Statutes, and in the event of any such petitions being filed against Sublessee, such petition shall not be dismissed within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date of filing of such petition; 
 (e) Sublessee shall become insolvent or make a transfer in fraud of creditors; 
 (f) Sublessee shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (g) a receiver shall be appointed for a substantial part of the assets of Sublessee; 
 (h) Sublessee’s interest in this Sublease shall be levied upon under execution; or 
    (i) Sublessee shall, other than in the ordinary course of business, remove or attempt to remove the personal property of Sublessor from the Premises. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Sublessor shall have the option to do any one or more of the following in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy permitted at law or in equity or under the terms of this Sublease: 
    (1) Terminate this Sublease, in which event the Sublessee shall immediately surrender the Premises to Sublessor. In the event of such termination, Sublessor may, at its option, declare up to the entire amount of the rentals which would otherwise become due and payable during the remainder of the Term to be due and payable immediately, in which event Sublessee shall pay the same at once, together with all rentals theretofore due at the office of the Sublessor; provided, however, that such payment shall not constitute payment in advance of the rentals for the remainder of said Term; or 
    (2) Enter the Premises as the agent of Sublessee, by reasonable force, if necessary, without being liable to prosecution for any claim for damages therefor; or 
    (3) Take all steps necessary to cure the breach or default, with the costs so incurred to be paid by Sublessee upon demand therefore; or 
    (4) Pursue all remedies available to Lessor pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease. No receipt of money by Sublessor from Sublessee after the termination of this Sublease or after service of any notice or after the commencement of any suit or final judgment for possession of the Premises shall reinstate, continue or extend the Term or affect any such termination, notice or suit. Pursuit by Sublessor of any of the foregoing remedies shall not preclude pursuit by Sublessor of any other remedies herein provided or at law or in equity. No waiver by Sublessor of any breach by Sublessee or of any of Sublessee’s obligations, agreements or covenants herein shall be a waiver of any subsequent breach or of any subsequent obligation, agreement or covenant, nor shall forbearance by Sublessor to seek a remedy for any breach by Sublessee be a waiver by Sublessor of any rights and remedies with respect to such or any subsequent breach. 
    
11. BROKER PARTICIPATION. Sublessor and Sublessee warrant and represent that they have dealt with no real estate broker in connection with this Sublease and that no broker is entitled to any commission on account of this Sublease. Sublessor and Sublessee shall each indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other from any and all claims, actual or threatened, for compensation by any such third person, by reason of Sublessor’s or Sublessee’s breach of its representations contained in this paragraph. 

12. NOTICES. All notices provided for under this Sublease shall be in writing and shall be sufficient if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, by prepaid nationally recognized overnight delivery service, or by hand delivery to the Party for whom such notice is intended, as follows: Sublessor: Cohen & Company 2929 Arch Street, Suite 1703 Philadelphia, PA 19104 Attention: Michael Shenkman Sublessee: Taberna Capital Management, LLC 2929 Arch Street, Suite 1703 Philadelphia, PA 19104 Attention: Jack Salmon 


13. GOVERNING LAW. This Sublease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 


14. ADHERENCE TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The failure of Sublessor to insist upon the strict performance by Sublessee of any term, condition or covenant on Sublessee’s part to be performed pursuant to the terms of this Sublease or to exercise any right, power or remedy of Sublessor contained in this Sublease shall not be or be deemed to be a waiver of such performance or relinquishment of such right now or at any time subsequent hereto. The receipt by Sublessor of any Rent required to be paid by Sublessee hereunder with knowledge of any Event of Default or default hereunder by Sublessee shall not be or be deemed to be a waiver of such default or Event of Default, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment of Rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction and Sublessee may accept any such check or payment without prejudice to Sublessor’s right to recover the balance of such Rent or to pursue any other right or remedy of Sublessor herein provided or provided at law or in equity. 

15. HEADINGS. The headings to various sections of this Sublease have been inserted for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or define or otherwise affect the express terms and provisions of this Sublease.

16. COUNTERPARTS. This Sublease may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; MODIFICATION. This Sublease contains the entire and only agreement between the parties concerning the Premises and no prior oral or written statements or representations, if any, of any party hereto or any representative of any party hereof, not contained in this instrument, shall have any force or effect. This Sublease shall not be modified in any way, except by a writing, executed by Sublessor and Sublessee, and no oral agreements or presentations for rental shall be deemed to constitute a Sublease other than this Agreement. This Sublease shall not be binding until it shall have been executed by Sublessor and Sublessee.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Sublease as of the date and year first above written.

The Premises shall be deemed “substantially completed” when the improvements called for by Article 4 have been completed to the extent that the Premises may be occupied by Tenant for its Permitted Uses, subject only to completion of minor finishing, adjustment of equipment, and other minor construction aspects, and Landlord has procured a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy permitting the occupancy of the Premises, if required by law and the common areas applicable to the Premises, including lobbies, hallways and elevators have been completed so that Tenant shall have access to the Premises (hereafter, “substantially completed”). Landlord shall keep Tenant aware of the progress of construction and continually update Tenant as to the anticipated substantial completion date. If upon substantial completion Landlord fails to provide to Tenant the necessary Building resources to allow Tenant to move (e.g., elevator) then the Commencement Date shall not occur until such resources are reasonable provided and Tenant has been given an opportunity to move to the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Term commence prior to December 1, 2005. The Term shall expire on the last day of the month which is 60 full months after the Commencement Date (“Expiration Date”). The Commencement Date shall be confirmed by Landlord and Tenant by the execution of a Confirmation of Lease Term in the form attached hereto as Exhibit “B”. If Tenant fails to execute or object to the Confirmation of Lease Term within ten (10) business days of its delivery, Landlord’s determination of such dates shall be deemed accepted.

(b) Upon notification by Landlord, Landlord and Tenant shall schedule a pre-occupancy inspection of the Premises at which time a punchlist of outstanding items, if any, shall be completed. Within a reasonable time thereafter but not to exceed 45 days or such reasonable period of time so long as Landlord is diligently pursuing such cure, Landlord shall complete the punchlist items to Tenant’s reasonable satisfaction.

4. CONSTRUCTION.

The Premises will be improved by Landlord for Tenant’s use as described in the Work Letter attached hereto as Exhibit “E” (“Tenant Work”). Landlord shall only be responsible for payment of a maximum cost of $45.00 per rentable square foot for the Tenant Work (the “Tenant Allowance”), all such costs in excess thereof to be borne by Tenant, and shall be paid to Landlord within thirty (30) days of written invoice, including backup documentation.

In the event the Commencement Date has not occurred by April 1, 2006 for any reason other than Tenant Delay or Force Majeure, then Fixed Rent shall abate during the Term on a day for day basis for each day after April 1, 2006 the Commencement Date has not occurred. In the event the Commencement Date has not occurred by June 1, 2006 for any reason other than Tenant Delay, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease on five business days prior written notice, provided that if the Commencement Date occurs within such five business days, such notice shall be null and void and of no force or effect.

The aforesaid late fee shall begin to accrue on the initial date of a payment due date, after any grace period granted hereunder. This provision shall not prevent Landlord from exercising any other remedy herein provided or otherwise available at law or in equity in the event of any default by Tenant.

(c) Rent for any partial month shall be approximately apportioned on a per diem basis.

(d) Tenant shall be required to pay a Security Deposit of $0 under this Lease.

18

(b) Tenant shall pay, in monthly installments in advance, on account of Tenant’s Allocated Share of Operating Expenses and Taxes, the estimated amount of such Recognized Expenses in excess of the Expense Stop for each year as determined by Landlord in its reasonable discretion and as set forth in a notice to Tenant, such notice to include the basis for such calculation. Prior to the end of the calendar year in which the Lease commences and thereafter for each successive calendar year (each, a “Lease Year”), or part thereof, Landlord may send to Tenant a statement of projected Recognized Expenses (a “Projection”) and shall indicate what Tenant’s Allocated Share of Recognized Expenses Taxes in excess of the Expense Stop shall be. Said amount shall be paid in equal monthly installments in advance by Tenant as Additional Rent commencing January 1 of the applicable Lease Year. Until a new Projection is received, payments shall continue at the then current rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 6, Landlord agrees that in no event shall “controllable expenses” exceed “controllable expenses” from the prior year by more than five (5%) percent. “Controllable expenses” are such expenses which are contracted for at a set rate and cannot fluctuate during the year, including, without limitation, janitorial and insurance costs, management and administrative fees, and landscaping and security expenses

(c) If during the course of any Lease Year, Landlord shall have reason to believe that the Recognized Expenses shall be different than that upon which the aforesaid projections were originally based, then Landlord, one time in any calendar year, shall be entitled to adjust the amount by reallocating the remaining payments for such year, for the months of the Lease Year which remain for the revised projections, and to advise Tenant of an adjustment in future monthly amounts to the end result that the Recognized Expenses shall be collected on a reasonably current basis each Lease Year.

(d) In calculating the Recognized Expenses as hereinbefore described, if for thirty (30) or more days during any Lease Year including the Base Year less than ninety-five (95%) percent of the Rentable Area of the Building shall have been occupied by tenants, then the Recognized Expenses shall be deemed for such Lease Year to be amounts equal to the Recognized Expenses which would normally be expected to be incurred had such occupancy of the Building been at least ninety-five (95%) percent throughout such year, as reasonably determined by Landlord (i.e., taking into account that certain expenses vary with occupancy (e.g., janitorial) and certain expenses do not (e.g., landscaping)). Furthermore, if Landlord shall not furnish any item or items of Recognized Expenses to any portions of the Building because such portions are not occupied or because such item is not required by the tenant of such portion of the Building, for the purposes of computing Recognized Expenses, an equitable adjustment shall be made so that the item of Operating Expense in question shall be shared only by tenants actually receiving the benefits thereof.

(e) By April 30th of each Lease Year or as soon thereafter as administratively available, Landlord shall send to Tenant a statement of actual expenses incurred for Recognized Expenses for the prior Lease Year showing the Allocated Share due from Tenant. If Landlord is unable to provide such statements by August 30, Landlord shall be deemed to waive its right to collect any such amounts as Additional Rent. In the event the amount prepaid by Tenant exceeds the amount that was actually due then Landlord shall issue a credit to Tenant in an amount equal to the over charge, which credit Tenant may apply to future payments on account of Recognized Expenses until Tenant has been fully credited with the over charge. If the credit due to Tenant is more than the aggregate total of future rental payments, Landlord shall pay to Tenant the difference between the credit in such aggregate total. In the event Landlord has undercharged Tenant, then Landlord shall send Tenant an invoice with the additional amount due, which amount shall be paid in full by Tenant within thirty (30) days of receipt.

(f) All Operating Expenses shall be charged at standard rates from the applicable service provider, with reduction on account of volume discounts or preferred vendor rates applicable to Landlord.

(g) If this Lease terminates other than at the end of a calendar year, Landlord’s annual estimate of Recognized Expenses shall be accepted by the parties as the actual Recognized Expenses for the year the Lease ends until Landlord provides Tenant with actual statements in accordance with subsection 6(e) above.

(h) Subject to the limitations set forth in Article 13, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord on demand reasonable and actual attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the processing and documentation of any

 

19

request for Landlord’s approval or consent in connection with assignment, subletting, change of ownership, or requests for non-disturbance agreements or Landlord and/or Lender waivers.

(a) Landlord shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Premises electricity as provided in Article 12. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, within thirty (30) business days of receipt of Landlord’s billing statement therefor, all charges actual incurred by Landlord, or its agent, for electricity, (including, without limitation, the cost for taxes, fuel adjustment charges, transfer charges and other like charges regularly passed on to the consumer by the public utility furnishing electricity to the Building and service, meter reading and billing charges), without markup, such charges to be based upon Tenant’s consumption at the rate that would be charged to Tenant for direct service as measured by Landlord’s meter for the Premises. Landlord has been advised that the rate for electricity shall be the high tension rate and Landlord shall pass through to Tenant only the actual rate assessed. The aforesaid electricity charges shall commence upon delivery to Tenant of the Premises. For purposes of this Article 7, from time to time during the Term, Landlord may enter the Premises to install, maintain, replace or read meters for electricity and/or to evaluate Tenant’s consumption of and demand for electricity.

(b) Landlord has advised Tenant that presently the Philadelphia Electric Company (“Electric Service Provider”) is the utility company selected by Landlord to provide electricity service for the Building. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if permitted by law, Landlord shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the Term to either contract for service from a different company or companies providing electricity service (each such company shall hereinafter be referred to as an “Alternate Service Provider”) or continue to contract for service from the Electric Service Provider so long as the same does not adversely affect Tenant or its use of the premises or increase the cost charged to Tenant. Tenant shall reasonably cooperate with Landlord, the Electric Service Provider, and any Alternate Service Provider at all times and, as reasonably necessary, shall allow Landlord, Electric Service Provider, and any Alternate Service Provider reasonable access to the Building’s electric lines, feeders, risers, wiring, and any other machinery and conduits within the Premises so long as such access does not materially or unreasonably interfere with Tenant’s use of the premises. Landlord shall in no way be liable or responsible for any loss, damage or expense that Tenant may sustain or incur by reason of any change or temporary failure, interference, disruption, or defect, through no fault of Landlord or its agents, employees or contractors, in the supply or character of the electric energy furnished to the Premises, or if, through no fault of Landlord or its agents, employees or contractors, the quantity or character of the electric energy supplied by the Electric Service Provider or any Alternate Service Provider is temporarily no longer available or suitable for Tenant’s requirements as long as Landlord proceeds with due diligence to correct such situation as promptly as possible. In any event, the provisions of Section 12(b) shall be applicable to such situation

Any amount so paid by Landlord, plus all of Landlord’s costs and expenses associated therewith (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees), shall constitute Additional Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand with interest from the date of advance by Landlord at the Default Rate.

(b) Nothing in this Lease, or in any consent to the making of alterations or improvements shall be deemed or construed in any way as constituting authorization by Landlord for the making of any alterations or additions by Tenant within the meaning of 49 P.S. Sections 1101-1902, as amended, or under the Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act or any amendment thereof, or constituting a request by Landlord, express or implied, to any contractor, subcontractor or supplier for the performance of any labor or the furnishing of any materials for the use or benefit of Landlord.

(iv) Janitorial. From and after the Commencement Date, provide to the Premises janitorial service for typical office use substantially in accordance with Exhibit “D”. Any and all additional or specialized janitorial service desired by Tenant shall be contracted for by Tenant directly with Landlord’s janitorial contractor at reasonably competitive rates and the cost and payment thereof shall be the sole responsibility of Tenant.

(v) Water. From and after the Commencement Date, provide water for drinking, and lavatory and toilet fixtures at the Building core and in the Premises.

(vi) Public Areas. From and after the Commencement Date, keep and maintain the public areas of the Building clean and in good working order, and the sidewalks adjoining the Building in good repair and reasonably free from accumulations of snow and ice.

24

(viii) Electricity. At Tenant’s cost as set forth in Article 7, from and after the Occupancy Date, furnish electric energy as required by Tenant for general light and power use in the Premises up to 6 watts per square foot of the Premises and the electric energy required by Tenant for distribution of the Building heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems to the Premises, all subject to the following:

(a) Tenant agrees, to the extent (if any) in the future required by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or federal or state law as a necessary condition to the supply of electric energy to the Premises, to become a metered customer of such public utility.

(b) Tenant’s use of electric energy in the Premises shall not at any time exceed the capacity of any of the electrical conductors and equipment in or serving the Premises. In the event that Tenant shall require electric energy for use in the Premises (exclusive of such electric energy as is required for distribution of the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems to the Premises) in excess of that to be provided as set forth above, and if, in Landlord’s sole judgment, Landlord’s facilities are inadequate for such additional requirements and if electric energy for such additional requirements is available to Landlord, Landlord, upon written request and at the cost and expense of Tenant, will furnish and install such additional wires, risers, conduits, feeders, switchboards and circuit panels as reasonably may be required to supply such additional requirements of Tenant, provided (x) that the same shall be permitted by applicable laws and insurance regulations, (y) that, in Landlord’s sole judgment, the same are necessary and will not cause damage or injury to the Building or the Premises or cause or create a dangerous or hazardous condition or entail excessive or unreasonable alterations or repairs or interfere with or disturb other tenants or occupants and (z) that Tenant, at Tenant’s expense, shall, concurrently with the making of such written request, execute and deliver to Landlord Tenant’s written undertaking, with a surety and in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord, obligating Tenant to fully and promptly pay the entire cost and expense of so furnishing and installing any such additional wires, risers, conduits, feeders, switchboards, and/or circuit panels, subject to Article 12(b).

(c) Tenant shall not install any equipment of any kind whatsoever which might necessitate any changes, replacements or additions to any of the heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, electric, sanitary, elevator or other systems serving the Premises or any other portion of the Building, or to any of the services required of Landlord under this Lease, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion, and in the event such consent is granted, such replacements, changes or additions shall be paid for by Tenant at Tenant’s sole and exclusive expense. At the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall pay Landlord’s cost of restoring such systems to their condition prior to such replacements, changes or additions. Without limiting the foregoing, no telecommunication carrier shall have the right to do any work for Tenant or use any space or facilities in the Building without Landlord’s prior written consent and such carrier, Landlord and Tenant entering into a License Agreement and Amendment to Lease in form and content acceptable to Landlord pursuant to which Landlord will permit access subject to its then current rates and procedures for use of equipment areas, risers and other facilities in the Building.

(b) If any of the services provided for in Article 12 or telecommunications (including equipment and personnel for any of the foregoing) are interrupted or stopped or if there is a defect in supply, character of, adequacy or quality of any of such services (collectively, a “Failure”), Landlord will use reasonable diligence to resume the service and correct the Failure; provided, however, no Failure of any of these services will create any liability for Landlord (including, without limitation, any liability for damages to Tenant’s personal property caused by any such Failure), constitute an actual or constructive eviction or, except as expressly provided below, cause any abatement of the Rent payable under this Lease or in any manner or for any purpose relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease. If, due to reasons within Landlord’s reasonable control, any of the services required to be provided by Landlord under Article 12 should become subject to a Failure and should remain subject to a Failure for a period in excess of 72 hours after notice of such Failure from Tenant to Landlord, and if such Failure should render all or any portion of the Premises untenantable so that Tenant is actually unable to use any or all of the Premises for the normal conduct of its business (“Untenantable”), then commencing upon the

 

25

expiration of such 72 hour period, Tenant’s Rent will equitably abate in proportion to the portion of the Premises so rendered Untenantable for so long as such services remain subject to the Failure for such reasons. Without limiting those reasons for a Failure that may be beyond Landlord’s reasonable control, any such Failure due to the following will be deemed caused by a reason beyond Landlord’s control: (i) that is required in order to comply with any laws, ordinances or requests from governmental authorities; (ii) any casualty; (iii) an accident; (iv) an emergency; (v) shortages of labor or materials; or (vi) any other causes of any kind whatsoever that are beyond the control of Landlord, including, but not limited to: (A) lack of access to the Building or the Premises (which shall include, but not be limited to, the lack of access to the Building or the Premises when it or they are structurally sound but inaccessible due to evacuation of the surrounding area or damage to nearby structures or public areas); (B) any cause outside the Building; (C) reduced air quality or other contaminants within the Building that would adversely affect the Building or its occupants (including, but not limited to, the presence of biological or other airborne agents within the Building or the Premises); (D) disruption of mail and deliveries to the Building or the Premises resulting from a casualty; (E) disruptions of telephone and telecommunications services to the Building or the Premises resulting from a casualty; or (F) blockages of any windows, doors, or walkways to the Building or the Premises resulting from a casualty.

Landlord reserves the right, without any liability to Tenant, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, and without being in breach of any covenant of this Lease, to effect a Failure, as required by this Lease or by law, or as Landlord in good faith deems advisable, whenever and for so long as may be necessary, to make repairs, alterations, upgrades, changes, or for any other reason, to the Building’s HVAC, utility, sanitary, elevator, water, telecommunications, security, or other Building systems serving the Premises, or any other services required of Landlord under this Lease.

13. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

(a) Subject to the remaining subsections of Article 13, except as expressly permitted pursuant to this section, Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, assign, transfer or hypothecate this Lease or any interest herein or sublet the Premises or any part thereof. Any of the foregoing acts without such consent shall be void and shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate this Lease. Subject to subparagraph 13(i) below, this Lease shall not, nor shall any interest herein, be assignable as to the interest of Tenant by operation of law or by merger, consolidation or asset sale, without the written consent of Landlord.

(b) If at any time or from time to time during the term of this Lease Tenant desires to assign this Lease or sublet all or any part of the Premises for the remainder of the Term and the same is not a Permitted Assignment or Sublet, Tenant shall give notice to Landlord of such desire, including the name, address and contact party for the proposed assignee or subtenant, a description of such party’s business history, the effective date of the proposed assignment or sublease (including the proposed occupancy date by the proposed assignee or sublessee), and in the instance of a proposed sublease, the square footage to be subleased, a floor plan professionally drawn to scale depicting the proposed sublease area, and a statement of the duration of the proposed sublease (which shall in any and all events expire by its terms prior to the scheduled expiration of this Lease, and immediately upon the sooner termination hereof). Landlord may, at its option, and in its sole and absolute discretion, exercisable by notice given to Tenant within sixty (60) days next following Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s notice (which notice from Tenant shall, as a condition of its effectiveness, include all of the above-enumerated information), elect to recapture the Premises if Tenant is proposing to sublet or assign the Premises or such portion as is proposed by Tenant to be sublet (and in each case, the designated and non-designated parking spaces included in this demise, or a pro-rata portion thereof in the instance of the recapture of less than all of the Premises), and terminate this Lease with respect to the space being recaptured. The parties acknowledge and agree that a Permitted Assignment or Sublet shall not trigger Landlord’s recapture right. A Permitted Assignment or Sublet is an assignment or sublet under Article 13 (i) and Article 13(j).

(c) If Landlord elects to recapture the Premises or a portion thereof as aforesaid, then from and after the effective date thereof as approved by Landlord, after Tenant shall have fully performed such obligations

 

26

as are enumerated herein to be performed by Tenant in connection with such recapture, and except as to obligations and liabilities accrued and unperformed (and any other obligations expressly stated in this Lease to survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease), Tenant shall be released of and from all lease obligations thereafter otherwise accruing with respect to the Premises (or such lesser portion as shall have been recaptured by Landlord). The Premises, or such portion thereof as Landlord shall have elected to recapture, shall be delivered by Tenant to Landlord free and clear of all furniture, furnishings, personal property and removable fixtures, with Tenant repairing and restoring any and all damage to the Premises resulting from the installation, handling or removal thereof, and otherwise in the same condition as Tenant is, by the terms of this Lease, required to redeliver the Premises to Landlord upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. In the event of a sublease of less than all of the Premises, the cost of erecting any required demising walls, entrances and entrance corridors, and any other or further improvements required in connection therewith, including without limitation, modifications to HVAC, electrical, plumbing, fire, life safety and security systems (if any), painting, wallpapering and other finish items as may be acceptable to or specified by Landlord, all of which improvements shall be made in accordance with applicable legal requirements and Landlord’s then-standard base building specifications, shall be performed by Landlord’s contractors, and shall be shared 50% by Tenant and 50% by Landlord. Upon the completion of any recapture and termination as provided herein, Tenant’s Fixed Rent, Recognized Expenses and other monetary obligations hereunder shall be adjusted pro-rated based upon the reduced rentable square footage then comprising the Premises.

(d) If Landlord provides written notification to Tenant electing not to recapture the Premises (or so much thereof as Tenant had proposed to sublease), then Tenant may proceed to market the designated space and may complete such transaction and execute an assignment of this Lease or a sublease agreement (in each case in form acceptable to Landlord) within a period of five (5) months next following Landlord’s notice to Tenant that it declines to recapture such space, provided that Tenant shall have first obtained in any such case the prior written consent of Landlord to such transaction, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If, however, Tenant shall not have assigned this Lease or sublet the Premises with Landlord’s prior written consent as aforesaid within five (5) months next following Landlord’s notice to Tenant that Landlord declines to recapture the Premises (or such portion thereof as Tenant initially sought to sublease), then in such event, Tenant shall again be required to request Landlord’s consent to the proposed transaction, whereupon Landlord’s right to recapture the Premises (or such portion as Tenant shall desire to sublease) shall be renewed upon the same terms and as otherwise provided in subsection (b) above.

For purposes of this Section 13(d), and without limiting the basis upon which Landlord may withhold its consent to any proposed assignment or sublease, the parties agree that it shall not be unreasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to such assignment or sublease if: (i) the proposed assignee or sublessee shall have a net worth which is not acceptable to Landlord in Landlord’s reasonable discretion; (ii) the proposed assignee or sublessee shall have no reliable credit history or an unfavorable credit history, or other reasonable evidence exists that the proposed assignee or sublessee will experience difficulty in satisfying its financial or other obligations under this Lease; (iii) the proposed assignee of sublessee, in Landlord’s reasonable opinion, is not reputable and of good character; (iv) the portion of the Premises requested to be subleased renders the balance of the Premises unleasable as a separate area; (v) or Tenant is proposing to assign or sublease to an existing tenant of the Building; or (vi) the nature of such party’s proposed business operation would or might reasonably permit or require the use of the Premises in a manner inconsistent with the “Permitted Use” specified herein, would or might reasonably otherwise be in conflict with express provisions of this Lease, would or might reasonably violate the terms of any other lease for the Building, or would, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, otherwise be incompatible with other tenancies in the Building.

(e) Any sums or other economic consideration received by Tenant as a result of any subletting, assignment or license (except rental or other payments received which are attributable to the amortization of the cost of leasehold improvements made to the sublet or assigned portion of the premises by Tenant for subtenant or assignee, and other reasonable expenses incident to the subletting or assignment, including standard leasing commissions) whether denominated rentals under the sublease or otherwise, which exceed, in the aggregate, the total sums which Tenant is obligated to pay Landlord under this Lease (prorated to reflect obligations allocable to that portion of the premises subject to such sublease or assignment) shall be divided evenly between Landlord and

 

27

Tenant, with Landlord’s portion being payable to Landlord as Additional Rental under this Lease without affecting or reducing any other obligation of Tenant hereunder.

(f) Regardless of Landlord’s consent, no subletting or assignment shall release Tenant of Tenant’s obligation or alter the primary liability of Tenant to pay the Rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Tenant hereunder. The acceptance of rental by Landlord from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision hereof. Consent to one assignment or subletting shall not be deemed consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting. In the event of default by any assignee of Tenant or any successor of Tenant in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Landlord may proceed directly against Tenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such assignee or successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Tenant is able to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord that the proposed assignee has a financial net worth of $10,000,000 or more and sufficient to satisfy the monetary obligations of Tenant under this Lease in accordance with Landlord’s standard credit analysis applied to tenants generally and the proposed assignee has a reputation for meeting its contractual obligations, then Landlord agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to Tenant’s request that it be released from the liability of Tenant to pay the Rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Tenant under this Lease upon any permitted assignment.

(g) In the event that (i) the Premises or any part thereof are sublet and Tenant is in default under this Lease, or (ii) this Lease is assigned by Tenant, then, Landlord may collect Rent from the assignee or subtenant and apply the net amount collected to the rent herein reserved; but no such collection shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions of this Article 13 with respect to assignment and subletting, or the acceptance of such assignee or subtenant as Tenant hereunder, or a release of Tenant from further performance of the covenants herein contained.

(h) Other than a Permitted Assignment or Sublet, in connection with each proposed assignment or subletting of the Premises by Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord (i) an administrative fee of $250 per request (including requests for non-disturbance agreements and Landlord’s or its lender’s waivers) in order to defer Landlord’s administrative expenses arising from such request, plus (ii) Landlord’s reasonable and actual attorneys’ fees not to exceed $1,000.

(i) Tenant may, after notice to, but without the consent of Landlord, assign this Lease or sublet a portion of the Premises to an affiliate (i.e., either a 50% or more ownership interest by the same parties owning 50% or more of Tenant’s ownership interest or another business entity which controls or is controlled by or is under common control with Tenant), parent or subsidiary entity of Tenant or to an entity to which it sells or assigns all of substantially all of its assets or stock or with which it may be consolidated or merged (“Affiliate”), provided such purchasing, consolidated, merged, affiliated or subsidiary entity shall, in writing, assume and agree to perform all of the obligations of Tenant under this Lease, shall have a net worth at least equal to $10,000,000, and it shall deliver such assumption with a copy of such assignment to Landlord within ten (10) days thereafter, and provided further that Tenant shall not be released or discharged from any liability under this Lease by reason of such assignment.

(j) Anything in this Article 12 to the contrary notwithstanding, no assignment or sublease shall be permitted under this Lease if Tenant is in default at the time of such assignment or has previously defaulted (irrespective of the fact that Tenant cured such default) more than twice in connection with any of its monetary obligations under this Lease and such monetary defaults aggregate in excess of $500,000. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord acknowledges that Tenant’s tenancy is predicated upon related entities, affiliates and/or customers of Tenant (“Permitted Occupants”) occupying the Premises either through an occupancy agreement or sublease. Provided any such Permitted Occupants does not occupy more than 75% of the Premises, in the aggregate, Landlord’s consent shall not be required hereunder for any occupancy with a Permitted Occupant and Landlord shall not be entitled to share any profit.

14. LANDLORD’S RIGHT OF ENTRY.

Landlord and persons authorized by Landlord may enter the Premises at all reasonable times upon reasonable advance notice (except in the case of an emergency in which case no prior notice is necessary) for the

 

28

purpose of inspections, repairs, alterations to adjoining space, appraisals, or other reasonable purposes; including enforcement of Landlord’s rights under this Lease. Landlord shall not be liable for inconvenience to or disturbance of Tenant by reason of any such entry; provided, however, that in the case of repairs or work, such shall be done, so far as practicable, so as to not unreasonably interfere with Tenant’s use of the Premises. Landlord will use overtime labor if necessary for such work at Landlord’s expense. Landlord also shall have the right to enter the Premises at all reasonable times after giving prior oral notice to Tenant, to exhibit the Premises to any prospective purchaser and/or mortgagee. During the last year of the Term, Landlord also shall have the right to enter the Premises at all reasonable times after giving prior oral notice to Tenant, to exhibit the Premises to any prospective tenants.

15. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.

(a) Tenant, at its sole cost and expense and throughout the Term of this Lease, shall keep and maintain the Premises in good order and condition, free of accumulation of dirt and rubbish, and shall promptly make all non-structural repairs necessary by virtue of Tenant’s actions or neglect to keep and maintain such good order and condition. Tenant shall not replace lights, ballasts, tubes, ceiling tiles, outlets and similar equipment itself and shall advise Landlord of Tenant’s desire to have Landlord make such repairs. If requested by Tenant, Landlord shall make such repairs to the Premises within a reasonable time of notice to Landlord and shall charge Tenant for such services at Landlord’s standard rate (such rate to be competitive with the market rate for such services). All repairs made by Tenant shall utilize materials and equipment which are at least equal in quality and usefulness to those originally used in constructing the Building and the Premises.

(b) Except as provided in subparagraph (a) of this article, Landlord shall make or cause to be made all repairs to the Premises and Building common area, all repairs which may be needed to the mechanical, HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems in and serving the Premises (excluding repairs to any supplemental HVAC systems, kitchens, any non-Building standard fixtures or other improvements or any other portions of the Premises or fixtures, equipment and improvements therein requiring maintenance of a type or nature not customarily provided by Landlord to office tenants of the Building), and all repairs to exterior windows and glass (including caulking and weather stripping). Landlord shall have no responsibility to make any repairs unless and until Landlord receives written notice of the need for such repair or Landlord has actual knowledge of the need to make such repair.

(c) Landlord shall keep and maintain all common areas appurtenant to the Building and any sidewalks, parking areas, curbs and access ways adjoining the Property in a clean and orderly condition, free of accumulation of dirt, rubbish, snow and ice, and shall keep and maintain all landscaped areas in a neat and orderly condition.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, repairs to the Premises, Building or Project and its appurtenant common areas made necessary by a negligent or willful act or omission of Tenant or any employee, agent, or contractor of Tenant shall be made by Landlord at the sole cost and expense of Tenant, payable on demand, except to the extent of insurance proceeds received by Landlord.

16. INSURANCE; SUBROGATION RIGHTS.

(a) Tenant shall obtain and keep in force at all times during the term hereof, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance including contractual liability and personal injury liability and all similar coverage, with combined single limits of $3,000,000.00 on account of bodily injury to or death of one or more persons as the result of any one accident or disaster and on account of damage to property, or in such other amounts as Landlord may from time to time require. Tenant shall also require its movers to procure and deliver to Landlord a certificate of insurance naming Landlord as an additional insured.

(b) Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain in full force and effect on all Tenant’s trade fixtures, equipment and personal property on the Premises, a policy of “special form” property insurance covering the full replacement value of such property.

 

29

(c) All liability insurance required hereunder shall not be subject to cancellation without at least thirty (30) days prior notice to all insureds, and shall name Landlord, Brandywine Realty Trust, Landlord’s Agent and Tenant as insureds, as their interests may appear, and, if requested by Landlord, shall also name as an additional insured any mortgagee or holder of any mortgage which may be or become a lien upon any part of the Premises. Prior to the commencement of the Term, Tenant shall provide Landlord with certificates which evidence that the coverages required have been obtained for the policy periods. Tenant shall also furnish to Landlord throughout the term hereof replacement certificates at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration dates of the then current policy or policies. All the insurance required under this Lease shall be issued by insurance companies authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with a financial rating of at least an A-IX as rated in the most recent edition of Best’s Insurance Reports and in business for the past five years. The limit of any such insurance shall not limit the liability of Tenant hereunder. If Tenant fails to procure and maintain such insurance, Landlord may, but shall not be required to, procure and maintain the same, at Tenant’s expense to be reimbursed by Tenant as Additional Rent within ten (10) days of written demand. Any deductible under such insurance policy or self-insured retention under such insurance policy in excess of Twenty Five Thousand ($25,000) must be approved by Landlord in writing prior to issuance of such policy. Tenant shall not self-insure without Landlord’s prior written consent. The policy limits set forth herein shall be subject to periodic review (but not during the initial Term), and Landlord reserves the right to require that Tenant increase the liability coverage limits if, in the reasonable opinion of Landlord, the coverage becomes inadequate or is less than commonly maintained by tenants of similar buildings in the area making similar uses.

(d) Landlord shall obtain and maintain the following insurance during the Term of this Lease: (i) replacement cost insurance including “special form” property insurance on the Building and on the Project, (ii) builder’s risk insurance for the Landlord Work to be constructed by Landlord in the Project, and (iii) commercial general liability insurance (including bodily injury and property damage) covering Landlord’s operations at the Project in amounts reasonably required by the Landlord’s lender or Landlord.

(e) Each party hereto, and anyone claiming through or under them by way of subrogation, waives and releases any cause of action it might have against the other party and Brandywine Realty Trust and their respective employees, officers, members, partners, trustees and agents, on account of any loss or damage that is insured against under any insurance policy required to be obtained hereunder (to the extent that such loss or damage is recoverable under such insurance policy) that covers the Project, Building or Premises, Landlord’s or Tenant’s fixtures, personal property, leasehold improvements or business and which names Landlord and Brandywine Realty Trust or Tenant, as the case may be, as a party insured. Each party hereto agrees that it will cause its insurance carrier to endorse all applicable policies waiving the carrier’s right of recovery under subrogation or otherwise against the other party. During any period while such waiver of right of recovery is in effect, each party shall look solely to the proceeds of such policies for compensation for loss, to the extent such proceeds are paid under such policies.

17. INDEMNIFICATION.

(a) Tenant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord and Brandywine Realty Trust and their respective employees and agents from and against any and all third-party claims, actions, damages, liability and expense (including all reasonable attorney’s fees, expenses and liabilities incurred in defense of any such claim or any action or proceeding brought thereon) arising from (i) Tenant’s improper use of the Premises, (ii) the improper conduct of Tenant’s business, (iii) any activity, work or things done, permitted or suffered by Tenant or its agents, licensees or invitees in or about the Premises or elsewhere contrary to the requirements of the Lease, (iv) any breach or default in the performance of any obligation of Tenant’s part to be performed under the terms of this Lease, and (v) any negligence or willful act of Tenant or any of Tenant’s agents, contractors, or employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant’s obligations shall include any case in which Landlord or Brandywine Realty Trust shall be made a party to any litigation commenced by or against Tenant, its agents, subtenants, licensees, concessionaires, contractors, customers or employees, then Tenant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord, Brandywine Realty Services Corp. and Brandywine Realty Trust and shall pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred or paid by Landlord and Brandywine Realty Trust in connection with such

 

30

litigation, after notice to Tenant and Tenant’s refusal to defend such litigation (related to activities described in the preceding sentence), and upon notice from Landlord shall defend the same at Tenant’s expense by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.

(b) Landlord shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Tenant and its respective employees and agents from and against any and all third-party claims, actions, damages, liability and expense (including all attorney’s fees, expenses and liabilities incurred in defense of any such claim or any action or proceeding brought thereon) arising from (i) Landlord’s improper use of the Premises, (ii) the improper conduct of Landlord’s business, (iii) any activity, work or things done, permitted or suffered by Landlord in or about the Premises or elsewhere contrary to the requirements of the Lease, (iv) any breach or default in the performance of any obligation of Landlord’s part to be performed under the terms of this Lease, (v) any negligence or willful act of Landlord or any of Landlord’s agents, contractors, employees or invitees; and (vi) any claims related to injuries and/or property damage at the Project but outside of the Premises. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Landlord’s obligations shall include any case in which Tenant shall be made a party to any litigation commenced by or against Landlord, its agents, subtenants, licensees, concessionaires, contractors, customers or employees, then Landlord shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Tenant and shall pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred or paid by Tenant in connection with such litigation, after notice to Landlord and Landlord’s refusal to defend such litigation, and upon notice from Tenant shall defend the same at Landlord’s expense by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Tenant.

18. QUIET ENJOYMENT.

Provided Tenant has performed all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, including the payment of Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, to be performed by Tenant, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Premises for the Term, without hindrance from Landlord, or anyone claiming by through or under Landlord under and subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease and of any mortgages now or hereafter affecting all of or any portion of the Premises.

19. FIRE DAMAGE.

(a) Except as provided below, in case of damage to the Premises by fire or other insured casualty, Landlord shall repair the damage. Such repair work shall be commenced promptly following notice of the damage and completed with due diligence, taking into account the time required for Landlord to effect a settlement with and procure insurance proceeds from the insurer, except for delays due to governmental regulation, scarcity of or inability to obtain labor or materials, intervening acts of God or other causes beyond Landlord’s reasonable control.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the damage is of a nature or extent that, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment (to be communicated to Tenant within thirty (30) days from the date of the casualty, failure to provide such notice shall be reason for Tenant to terminate this Lease, upon reasonable notice and Landlord’s opportunity to cure), the repair and restoration work would require more than two hundred ten (210) consecutive days to complete after the casualty (assuming normal work crews not engaged in overtime), or (ii) if more than thirty (30%) percent of the total area of the Building is extensively damaged, or (iii) the casualty occurs in the last Lease Year of the Term and Tenant has not exercised a renewal right, either party shall have the right to terminate this Lease and all the unaccrued obligations of the parties hereto, by sending written notice of such termination to the other within ten (10) days of Tenant’s receipt of the notice from Landlord described above. Such notice is to specify a termination date no less than fifteen (15) days after its transmission. Landlord shall no right to terminate this Lease unless it terminates all leases in the Building and elects not to rebuild.

(c) If the insurance proceeds received by Landlord as dictated by the terms and conditions of any financing then existing on the Building, (excluding any rent insurance proceeds) would not be sufficient to pay for repairing the damage or are required to be applied on account of any mortgage which encumbers any part of the Premises or Building, or if the nature of loss is not covered by Landlord’s fire insurance coverage, Landlord may elect either to (i) repair the damage as above provided notwithstanding such fact or (ii) terminate this Lease by giving Tenant notice of Landlord’s election as aforesaid.

 

31

(d) In the event Landlord has not completed restoration of the Premises within two hundred ten (210) days from the date of casualty, Tenant may terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) business days following the expiration of such 210 day period unless, within thirty (30) days following receipt of such notice, Landlord has substantially completed such restoration and delivered the Premises to Tenant for occupancy.

(e) In the event of damage or destruction to the Premises or any part thereof, Tenant’s obligation to pay Fixed Rent and Additional Rent shall be equitably adjusted or abated including an additional forty-five (45) days after Landlord has substantially completed the restoration of the Premises.

20. SUBORDINATION; RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE.

(a) This Lease is and shall be subject and subordinate at all times to the lien of any mortgage, deed of trust and/or other encumbrance now existing or hereafter placed by Landlord upon the Building and all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof (all of which are hereinafter referred to collectively as a “Mortgage” and the holder thereof, a “Holder”), all automatically and without the necessity of any further action on the part of Tenant to effectuate such subordination. Tenant shall, at the request of any person who may acquire Landlord’s estate by foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure (a “Successor”), attorn to such person, and shall execute, acknowledge and deliver, upon demand by Landlord or any Holder or its assignee, but in no event later than ten (10) days after such demand, such further instruments evidencing such subordination, and such further instruments evidencing such attornment obligation, as shall be reasonably requested by such Holder or its assignee. Default by Tenant hereunder is not subject to notice and/or opportunity to cure.

(b) Anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this Article 20 to the contrary notwithstanding, any such Holder may at any time subordinate, in whole or in part, its Mortgage to the operation and effect of this Lease, without the necessity of obtaining Tenant’s consent thereto, by giving notice of the same in writing to Tenant, and thereupon this Lease shall be deemed to be prior to such Mortgage without regard to their respective dates of execution, delivery and/or recordation, and in that event, such Holder shall have the same rights with respect to this Lease as though this Lease were executed, delivered and recorded prior to the execution and delivery of such Mortgage.

(c) If Landlord is or becomes a tenant leasing the Building or the land upon which it stands, then Tenant agrees that Tenant’s possession shall be that of a subtenant and subordinate to the interest of Landlord’s lessor, its heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns (such lessor and other persons being hereinafter collectively referred to as an “Overlessor”) without the necessity of any further action on the part of Tenant to effectuate such subordination, but notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord’s tenancy shall terminate either by expiration, forfeiture or otherwise, then, if the Overlessor shall so request, Tenant shall attorn to the Overlessor and recognize the Overlessor as Tenant’s landlord (and also a “Successor”) upon the terms and conditions of this Lease for the balance of the Term hereof and any extensions or renewals hereof. Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver, upon demand by Landlord or any Overlessor, such further instruments evidencing such subordination of Tenant’s right, title and interest under this Lease to the interests of an Overlessor, and such further instruments of attornment, as shall be reasonably requested by such Overlessor. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Overlessor shall become the landlord hereunder and if Tenant is otherwise entitled to itself receive the Tenant Allowance set forth in Article 4 and such Tenant Allowance was not paid to Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to offset Rent by the remaining unpaid Tenant Allowance.

(d) Upon attornment, this Lease will continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between the Successor and Tenant upon all of the same terms, conditions and covenants as stated in this Lease except that a Successor shall not be (a) liable for any previous act or omission or negligence of Landlord under this Lease which is not continuing after foreclosure, (b) subject to any counterclaim defense or offset not expressly provided for in this Lease and asserted with reasonable promptness, which theretofore shall have accrued to Tenant against Landlord, (c)

 

32

bound by any previous modification or amendment of this Lease or by any previous prepayment of more than one month’s Rent, unless such modification or prepayment shall have been approved in writing by the Holder or Overlessor (provided Tenant has express written notice of the existence of each Holder and/or Overlessor) through or by reason of which the Successor shall have succeeded to the rights of Landlord under this Lease, (d) obligated to perform any repairs or other work beyond Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, (e) liable for the payment of any security deposit unless the same has been delivered to Successor, (f) bound by any obligation to pay for services prior to foreclosure, or (g) responsible for any monies owed by Landlord to Tenant. Tenant agrees, upon request by and without cost to the Successor, to promptly execute and deliver to the Successor such instrument(s) as may be reasonably required to evidence such attornment. To the extent any Overlessor and/or Successor shall require Tenant’s written agreement to its attornment hereunder, such agreement shall contain such Overlessor’s and/or Successor’s covenant not to disturb Tenant’s occupancy. Attached hereto as Exhibit “F” is the standard form of subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement (“SNDA”) of the current Overlessor. Landlord agrees that it shall provide to Tenant an executed SNDA in the form as attached as Exhibit “E” within thirty (30) days of full execution of this Lease and if Tenant requests changes to such form then Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Tenant an executed SNDA as requested within sixty days of full execution of this Lease.

(e) In the event Landlord shall be or is alleged to be in default of any of its obligations owing to Tenant under this Lease, Tenant agrees to give to any Holder or Overlessor notice by overnight mail of any such default which Tenant shall have served upon Landlord, provided that prior thereto Tenant has been notified in writing (by way of Notice of Assignment of Rents and/or Leases or otherwise in writing to Tenant) of the name and addresses of any such Holder or Overlessor. Tenant shall not be entitled to exercise any right or remedy as there may be because of any default by Landlord without having given such notice to the Holder or Overlessor; and Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall fail to cure such default, the Holder or Overlessor shall have thirty (30) additional days (measured from the later of the date on which Landlord’s receipt of such notice from Tenant), within which to cure such default, provided that if such default be such that the same could not be cured within such period and Holder or Overlessor is diligently pursuing the remedies necessary to effectuate the cure (including, but not limited to, foreclosure proceedings if necessary to effectuate the cure) but in no event more than an additional thirty (30) days; then Tenant shall not exercise any right or remedy as there may be arising because of Landlord’s default, including but not limited to, termination of this Lease as may be expressly provided for herein or available to Tenant as a matter of law, if the Holder or Overlessor either has cured the default within such time periods, or as the case may be, has initiated the cure of same within such period and is diligently pursuing the cure of same as aforesaid

21. CONDEMNATION.

(a) If more than twenty (20%) percent of the floor area of the Premises is taken or condemned for a public or quasi-public use (a sale in lieu of condemnation to be deemed a taking or condemnation for purposes of this Lease), this Lease shall, at either party’s option, terminate as of the date title to the condemned real estate vests in the condemnor, and the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent herein reserved shall be apportioned and paid in full by Tenant to Landlord to that date and all rent prepaid for period beyond that date shall forthwith be repaid by Landlord to Tenant and neither party shall thereafter have any liability hereunder.

(b) If less than twenty (20%) percent of the floor area of the Premises is taken or if neither Landlord nor Tenant have elected to terminate this Lease pursuant to the preceding sentence, Landlord shall do such work as may be reasonably necessary to restore the portion of the Premises not taken to tenantable condition for Tenant’s uses, but shall not be required to expend more than the net award Landlord reasonably expects to be available for restoration of the Premises. If Landlord determines that the damages available for restoration of the Building and/or Project will not be sufficient to pay the cost of restoration, or if the condemnation damage award is required to be applied on account of any mortgage which encumbers any part of the Premises, Building and/or Project, Landlord may terminate this Lease by giving Tenant thirty (30) days prior notice specifying the termination date.

(c) If this Lease is not terminated after any such taking or condemnation, the Fixed Rent and the Additional Rent shall be equitably reduced in proportion to the area of the Premises which has been taken for the balance of the Term.

 

33

(d) If a part or all of the Premises shall be taken or condemned, all compensation awarded upon such condemnation or taking shall go to Landlord and Tenant shall have no claim thereto other than Tenant’s damages associated with moving, storage and relocation; and Tenant hereby expressly waives, relinquishes and releases to Landlord any claim for damages or other compensation to which Tenant might otherwise be entitled because of any such taking or limitation of the leasehold estate hereby created, and irrevocably assigns and transfers to Landlord any right to compensation of all or a part of the Premises or the leasehold estate.

22. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE.

Each party agrees at any time and from time to time, within ten (10) days after the other party’s written request, to execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other party a written instrument in recordable form certifying all information reasonably requested, including but not limited to, the following: that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that it is in full force and effect as modified and stating the modifications), the Commencement Date, the expiration date of this Lease, the square footage of the Premises, the rental rates applicable to the Premises, the dates to which Rent, Additional Rent, and other charges have been paid in advance, if any, and stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the party signing such certificate, the requesting party is in default in the performance of any covenant, agreement or condition contained in this Lease and, if so, specifying each such default of which the signer may have knowledge. It is intended that any such certification and statement delivered pursuant to this Article may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser of the Project or any mortgagee thereof or any assignee of Landlord’s interest in this Lease or of any mortgage upon the fee of the Premises or any part thereof.

23. DEFAULT.

If:

(a) Tenant fails to pay any installment of Fixed Rent or any amount of Additional Rent when due; provided, however, Landlord shall provide written notice of the failure to pay such Rent and Tenant shall have a ten (10) day grace period from its receipt of such Landlord’s notice within which to pay such Rent without creating a default hereunder. No additional notice shall be required thereafter and Landlord shall be entitled to immediately exercise its remedies hereunder if payment is not received during the grace period,

(b) Tenant fails to bond over a construction or mechanics lien within the time period set forth in Article 11,

(c) Tenant fails to observe or perform any of Tenant’s other non-monetary agreements or obligations herein contained within thirty (30) days after written notice specifying the default, or the expiration of such additional time period as is reasonably necessary to cure such default, provided Tenant immediately commences and thereafter proceeds with all due diligence and in good faith to cure such default,

(d) Tenant makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors,

(e) a petition is filed or any proceeding is commenced against Tenant or by Tenant under any federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law and such petition or proceeding is not dismissed within ninety (90) days,

(f) a receiver or other official is appointed for Tenant or for a substantial part of Tenant’s assets or for Tenant’s interests in this Lease,

 

34

(g) any attachment or execution against a substantial part of Tenant’s assets or of Tenant’s interests in this Lease remains unstayed or undismissed for a period of more than thirty (30) days, or

(h) a substantial part of Tenant’s assets or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease is taken by legal process in any action against Tenant,

then, in any such event, an Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and Tenant shall be in default hereunder.

If an Event of Default shall occur, the following provisions shall apply and Landlord shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity, the rights and remedies set forth therein, which rights and remedies may be exercised upon or at any time following the occurrence of an Event of Default unless, prior to such exercise, Landlord shall agree in writing with Tenant that the Event(s) of Default has been cured by Tenant in all respects.

(a) Acceleration of Rent. By notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have the right to accelerate all Fixed Rent and all expense installments due hereunder and otherwise payable in installments over the remainder of the Term, and, at Landlord’s option, any other Additional Rent to the extent that such Additional Rent can be determined and calculated to a fixed sum; and the amount of accelerated rent to the termination date, without further notice or demand for payment, shall be due and payable by Tenant within five (5) days after Landlord has so notified Tenant, such amount collected from Tenant shall be discounted to present value using an interest rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. Additional Rent which has not been included, in whole or in part, in accelerated rent, shall be due and payable by Tenant during the remainder of the Term, in the amounts and at the times otherwise provided for in this Lease.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or the application of any rule of law based on election of remedies or otherwise, if Tenant fails to pay the accelerated rent in full when due, Landlord thereafter shall have the right by notice to Tenant, (i) to terminate Tenant’s further right to possession of the Premises and (ii) to terminate this Lease under subparagraph (b) below; and if Tenant shall have paid part but not all of the accelerated rent, the portion thereof attributable to the period equivalent to the part of the Term remaining after Landlord’s termination of possession or termination of this Lease shall be applied by Landlord against Tenant’s obligations owing to Landlord, as determined by the applicable provisions of subparagraphs (c) and (d) below.

(b) Termination of Lease. By notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease as of a date specified in the notice of termination and in such case, Tenant’s rights, including any based on any option to renew, to the possession and use of the Premises shall end absolutely as of the termination date; and this Lease shall also terminate in all respects except for the provisions hereof regarding Landlord’s damages and Tenant’s liabilities arising prior to, out of and following the Event of Default and the ensuing termination.

Following such termination and the notice of same provided above (as well as upon any other termination of this Lease by expiration of the Term or otherwise) Landlord immediately shall have the right to recover possession of the Premises; and to that end, Landlord may enter the Premises and take possession, without the necessity of giving Tenant any notice to quit or any other further notice, with or without legal process or proceedings, and in so doing Landlord may remove Tenant’s property (including any improvements or additions to the Premises which Tenant made, unless made with Landlord’s consent which expressly permitted Tenant to not remove the same upon expiration of the Term), as well as the property of others as may be in the Premises, and make disposition thereof in such manner as Landlord may deem to be commercially reasonable and necessary under the circumstances.

(c) Tenant’s Continuing Obligations/Landlord’s Reletting Rights.

(i) Unless and until Landlord shall have terminated this Lease under subparagraph (b) above, Tenant shall remain fully liable and responsible to perform all of the covenants and to observe all the conditions of this Lease throughout the remainder of the Term to the early termination date; and, in addition, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, upon demand and as Additional Rent, the total sum of all costs, losses, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, as Landlord incurs, directly or indirectly, because of any Event of Default having occurred.

 

35

(ii) If Landlord either terminates Tenant’s right to possession without terminating this Lease or terminates this Lease and Tenant’s leasehold estate as above provided, then, subject to the provisions below, Landlord shall have the unrestricted right to relet the Premises or any part(s) thereof to such tenant(s) on such provisions and for such period(s) as Landlord may deem appropriate. Landlord agrees, however, to use reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages, provided that Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for its inability to mitigate damages if it shall endeavor to relet the Premises in like manner as it offers other comparable vacant space or property available for leasing to others in the Project of which the Building is a part. If Landlord relets the Premises after such a default, the costs recovered from Tenant shall be reallocated to take into consideration any additional rent which Landlord receives from the new tenant which is in excess to that which was owed by Tenant.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, in the event of a default under this Lease (including the filing of bankruptcy by or against Tenant), all personal property of Tenant at the Building, shall become Landlord’s property, shall constitute security of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease and shall not be removed by Tenant from the Building.

(d) Landlord’s Damages.

(i) The damages which Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant shall be the sum of:

(A) all Fixed Rent and Additional Rent accrued and unpaid as of the termination date; and

(B) (i) all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in recovering possession of the Premises, including removal and storage of Tenant’s property, (ii) the costs and expenses of restoring the Premises to the condition in which the same were to have been surrendered by Tenant as of the expiration of the Term, and (iii) the costs of reletting commissions; and

(C) all Fixed Rent and Additional Rent (to the extent that the amount(s) of Additional Rent has been then determined) otherwise payable by Tenant over the remainder of the Term as reduced to present value.

Less deducting from the total determined under subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) all Rent and all other Additional Rent to the extent determinable as aforesaid, (to the extent that like charges would have been payable by Tenant) which Landlord receives from other tenant(s) by reason of the leasing of the Premises or part during or attributable to any period falling within the otherwise remainder of the Term.

(ii) The damage sums payable by Tenant under the preceding provisions of this paragraph (d) shall be payable on demand from time to time as the amounts are determined; and if from Landlord’s subsequent receipt of rent as aforesaid from reletting, there be any excess payment(s) by Tenant by reason of the crediting of such rent thereafter received, the excess payment(s) shall be refunded by Landlord to Tenant, without interest.

(iii) Landlord may enforce and protect the rights of Landlord hereunder by a suit or suits in equity or at law for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein, and for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy, including, without limitation, injunctive relief, and for recovery of consequential damages and all moneys due or to become due from Tenant under any of the provisions of this Lease.

 

36

(e) Landlord’s Right to Cure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Tenant shall have committed an Event of Default, Landlord, without being required to give Tenant any notice or opportunity to cure, may (but shall not be obligated to do so), in addition to any other rights it may have in law or in equity, cure such default on behalf of Tenant, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for any sums paid or costs incurred by Landlord in curing such default, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, together with interest at 10% per annum Rate from the dates of Landlord’s incurring of costs or expenses.

Tenant further waives the right to any notices to quit as may be specified in the Landlord and Tenant Act of Pennsylvania, Act of April 6, 1951, as amended, or any similar or successor provision of law, and agrees that five (5) days notice shall be sufficient in any case where a longer period may be statutorily specified.

(f) Additional Remedies. In addition to, and not in lieu of any of the foregoing rights granted to Landlord, and upon at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice including which notice shall include the pleadings:

(i) WHEN THIS LEASE OR TENANT’S RIGHT OF POSSESSION SHALL BE TERMINATED BY COVENANT OR CONDITION BROKEN, OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON, EITHER DURING THE TERM OF THIS LEASE OR ANY RENEWAL OR EXTENSION THEREOF, AND ALSO WHEN AND AS SOON AS THE TERM HEREBY CREATED OR ANY EXTENSION THEREOF SHALL HAVE EXPIRED, IT SHALL BE LAWFUL FOR ANY ATTORNEY AS ATTORNEY FOR TENANT TO FILE AN AGREEMENT FOR ENTERING IN ANY COMPETENT COURT AN ACTION TO CONFESS JUDGMENT IN EJECTMENT AGAINST TENANT AND ALL PERSONS CLAIMING UNDER TENANT, WHEREUPON, IF LANDLORD SO DESIRES, A WRIT OF EXECUTION OR OF POSSESSION MAY ISSUE FORTHWITH, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WRIT OF PROCEEDINGS, WHATSOEVER, AND PROVIDED THAT IF FOR ANY REASON AFTER SUCH ACTION SHALL HAVE BEEN COMMENCED THE SAME SHALL BE DETERMINED AND THE POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES HEREBY DEMISED REMAIN IN OR BE RESTORED TO TENANT, LANDLORD SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT UPON ANY SUBSEQUENT DEFAULT OR DEFAULTS, OR UPON THE TERMINATION OF THIS LEASE AS HEREINBEFORE SET FORTH, TO BRING ONE OR MORE ACTION OR ACTIONS AS HEREINBEFORE SET FORTH TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE SAID PREMISES.

In any action to confess judgment in ejectment, Landlord shall first cause to be filed in such action an affidavit made by it or someone acting for it setting forth the facts necessary to authorize the entry of judgment, of which facts such affidavit shall be conclusive evidence, and if a true copy of this Lease (and of the truth of the copy such affidavit shall be sufficient evidence) be filed in such action, it shall not be necessary to file the original as a warrant of attorney, any rule of Court, custom or practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

___________(INITIAL). TENANT WAIVER. TENANT SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TENANT HAS VOLUNTARILY, KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVED CERTAIN DUE PROCESS RIGHTS TO A PREJUDGMENT HEARING BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS OF THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPHS REGARDING CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT. TENANT FURTHER SPECIFICALLY AGREES THAT IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT, LANDLORD MAY PURSUE MULTIPLE REMEDIES INCLUDING OBTAINING POSSESSION PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT BY CONFESSION AND EXECUTING UPON SUCH JUDGMENT. IN SUCH EVENT AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN, LANDLORD SHALL PROVIDE FULL CREDIT TO TENANT FOR ANY MONTHLY CONSIDERATION WHICH LANDLORD RECEIVES FOR THE LEASED PREMISES IN MITIGATION OF ANY OBLIGATION OF TENANT TO LANDLORD FOR THAT MONEY. FURTHERMORE, TENANT SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ANY CLAIM AGAINST LANDLORD AND LANDLORD’S COUNSEL FOR VIOLATION OF TENANT’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THE EVENT THAT JUDGMENT IS CONFESSED PURSUANT TO THIS LEASE.

(g) Interest on Damage Amounts. Any sums payable by Tenant hereunder, which are not paid after the same shall be due, shall bear interest from that day until paid at the rate of four (4%) percent over the

 

37

then Prime Rate as published daily under the heading “Money Rates” in The Wall Street Journal, unless such rate be usurious as applied to Tenant, in which case the highest permitted legal rate shall apply (the “Default Rate”).

(h) Landlord’s Statutory Rights. Landlord shall have all rights and remedies now or hereafter existing at law or in equity with respect to the enforcement of Tenant’s obligations hereunder and the recovery of the Premises. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Landlord shall be exclusive of any other right or remedy, but shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law. Landlord shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened violation, of any covenant, agreement, condition or provision of this Lease, or to a decree compelling performance of any covenant, agreement, condition or provision of this Lease.

(i) Remedies Not Limited. Nothing herein contained shall limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to exercise any or all rights and remedies available to Landlord by reason of default or to prove for and obtain in proceedings under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, the damages are to be proved, whether or not the amount be greater, equal to, or less than the amount of the loss or damage referred to above.

(j) No Waiver by Landlord. No delay or forbearance by Landlord in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, or Landlord’s undertaking or performing any act or matter which is not expressly required to be undertaken by Landlord shall be construed, respectively, to be a waiver of Landlord’s rights or to represent any agreement by Landlord to undertake or perform such act or matter thereafter. Waiver by Landlord of any breach by Tenant of any covenant or condition herein contained (which waiver shall be effective only if so expressed in writing by Landlord) or failure by Landlord to exercise any right or remedy in respect of any such breach shall not constitute a waiver or relinquishment for the future of Landlord’s right to have any such covenant or condition duly performed or observed by Tenant, or of Landlord’s rights arising because of any subsequent breach of any such covenant or condition nor bar any right or remedy of Landlord in respect of such breach or any subsequent breach. Landlord’s receipt and acceptance of any payment from Tenant which is tendered not in conformity with the provisions of this Lease or following an Event of Default (regardless of any endorsement or notation on any check or any statement in any letter accompanying any payment) shall not operate as an accord and satisfaction or a waiver of the right of Landlord to recover any payments then owing by Tenant which are not paid in full, or act as a bar to the termination of this Lease and the recovery of the Premises because of Tenant’s previous default.

(k) No Waiver by Tenant. No delay or forbearance by Tenant in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, or Tenant’s undertaking or performing any act or matter which is not expressly required to be undertaken by Tenant shall be construed, respectively, to be a waiver of Tenant’s rights or to represent any agreement by Tenant to undertake or perform such act or matter thereafter. Waiver by Tenant of any breach by Landlord of any covenant or condition herein contained (which waiver shall be effective only if so expressed in writing by Tenant) or failure by Tenant to exercise any right or remedy in respect of any such breach shall not constitute a waiver or relinquishment for the future of Tenant’s right to have any such covenant or condition duly performed or observed by Landlord, or of Tenant’s rights arising because of any subsequent breach of any such covenant or condition nor bar any right or remedy of Tenant in respect of such breach or any subsequent breach. Tenant’s receipt and acceptance of any payment from Landlord which is tendered not in conformity with the provisions of this Lease or following an Event of Default (regardless of any endorsement or notation on any check or any statement in any letter accompanying any payment) shall not operate as an accord and satisfaction or a waiver of the right of Tenant to recover any payments then owing by Landlord which are not paid in full, or act as a bar to the termination of this Lease and the recovery of the Premises because of Landlord’s previous default.

24. LANDLORD’S LIEN.

Intentionally Omitted.

 

38

25. LANDLORD’S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant that: (a) Landlord is the owner of the Building and the Project; (b) Landlord has the authority to enter into this Lease and (c) the person executing this Lease is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Lease on behalf of Landlord.

26. SURRENDER.

Tenant shall, at the expiration of the Term, promptly quit and surrender the Premises in good order and condition and in conformity with the applicable provisions of this Lease, excepting only reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire or other insured casualty. Tenant shall have no right to hold over beyond the expiration of the Term and in the event Tenant shall fail to deliver possession of the Premises as herein provided, such occupancy shall not be construed to effect or constitute other than a tenancy at sufferance. During the first sixty (60) days beyond the expiration of the Term the amount of rent owed to Landlord by Tenant shall automatically become one hundred fifty percent (150%) the sum of the Rent as those sums are at that time calculated under the provisions of the Lease. If Tenant fails to surrender the space within sixty (60) days of the termination date, Landlord may elect to automatically extend the Term for an additional month, with a Rent of two hundred percent (200%) the sum of the Fixed Rent as those sums are at that time calculated under the provisions of the Lease. The acceptance of rent by Landlord or the failure or delay of Landlord in notifying or evicting Tenant following the expiration or sooner termination of the Term shall not create any tenancy rights in Tenant and any such payments by Tenant may be applied by Landlord against its legal costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by Landlord as a result of such holdover.

27. RULES AND REGULATIONS.

Tenant agrees that at all times during the terms of this Lease (as same may be extended) it, its employees, agents, invitees and licenses shall comply with all rules and regulations specified on Exhibit “C” attached hereto and made a part hereof, together with all reasonable Rules and Regulations as Landlord may from time to time reasonably promulgate provided they do not increase the financial burdens of Tenant or unreasonably restrict Tenant’s rights under this Lease and they are imposed on all tenants of the Building uniformly. Tenant’s right to dispute the reasonableness of any changes in or additions to the Rules and Regulations shall be deemed waived unless asserted to Landlord within thirty (30) business days after Landlord shall have given Tenant written notice of any such adoption or change. In case of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Lease and any Rules and Regulations, the provisions of this Lease shall control. Landlord shall have no duty or obligation to enforce any Rule and Regulation, or any term, covenant or condition of any other lease, against any other tenant, and Landlord’s failure or refusal to enforce any Rule or Regulation or any term, covenant of condition of any other lease against any other tenant shall be without liability of Landlord to Tenant. However, if Landlord does enforce Rules or Regulations, Landlord shall enforce same equally in a non-discriminatory manner.

28. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS.

(a) Tenant shall, in the use and occupancy of the Premises and the conduct of Tenant’s business or profession therein, at all times comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, orders, notices, rules and regulations of the federal, state and municipal governments, or any of their departments and the regulations of the insurers of the Premises, Building and/or Project (“Laws”) Landlord shall be responsible for compliance with Laws with respect to all areas in the Project (except for the Premises (or any premises) resulting from Tenant’s (or any tenant’s) specific use and occupancy) and for any necessary structural and/or systems repairs generally serving the Building.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant shall (i) obtain, at Tenant’s expense, before engaging in Tenant’s business or profession within the Premises, all necessary licenses and permits including (but not limited to) state and local business licenses or permits, and (ii) remain in compliance with and keep in full force and effect at all times all licenses, consents and permits necessary for the lawful conduct of Tenant’s business or profession at the Premises. Tenant shall pay all personal property taxes, income taxes and other taxes, assessments, duties, impositions and similar charges which are or may be assessed, levied or imposed upon Tenant

 

39

and which, if not paid, could be liened against the Premises or against Tenant’s property therein or against Tenant’s leasehold estate.

(c) Landlord shall be responsible for compliance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of l990, 42 U.S.C. ‘12181 et seq. and its regulations, (collectively, the “ADA”) (i) as to the design and construction of exterior common areas (e.g. sidewalks and parking areas) and (ii) with respect to the initial design and construction by Landlord of Landlord’s Work (as defined in Article 4 hereof). Except as set forth above in the initial sentence hereto, Tenant shall be responsible for compliance with the ADA in all other respects concerning the use and occupancy of the Premises, which compliance shall include, without limitation (i) provision for full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations of the Premises as contemplated by and to the extent required by the ADA, (ii) compliance relating to requirements under the ADA or amendments thereto arising after the date of this Lease and (iii) compliance relating to the design, layout, renovation, redecorating, refurbishment, alteration, or improvement to the Premises made or requested by Tenant at any time following completion of the Landlord’s Work.

29. NOTICES.

(a) Wherever in this Lease it shall be required or permitted that notice or demand be given or served by either party to this Lease to or on the other party, such notice or demand shall be deemed to have been duly given or served if in writing and either: (i) personally served; (ii) delivered by pre-paid nationally recognized overnight courier service (e.g. Federal Express) with evidence of receipt required for delivery; and (iii) forwarded by Registered or Certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid in all such cases addressed to the parties at the addresses set forth in Article 1(l) hereof. Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given to or served upon the party to which addressed on the date the same is delivered or delivery is refused. Either party hereto may change its address to which said notice shall be delivered or mailed by giving written notice of such change to the other party hereto, as herein provided.

30. BROKERS.

Landlord and Tenant each represents and warrants to the other that such party has had no dealings, negotiations or consultations with respect to the Premises or this transaction with any broker or finder other than the Broker identified in Article 1(l); and that otherwise no broker or finder called the Premises to Tenant’s attention for lease or took any part in any dealings, negotiations or consultations with respect to the Premises or this Lease. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against all liability, cost and expense, including attorney’s fees and court costs, arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of warranty under this Article.

31. RIGHTS RESERVED BY LANDLORD.

(a) Landlord explicitly retains all rights, including, without limitation, the following rights, each of which Landlord may exercise without notice to Tenant and without liability to Tenant for damage or injury to property, person or business on account of the exercise thereof except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, and the exercise of any such rights shall not be deemed to constitute an eviction or disturbance of Tenant’s use or possession of the Premises and shall not give rise to any claim for setoff or abatement of Rent or any other claim:

(i) To change the name or street address of the Building; to give the Project any name or names that Landlord may choose and to change such name(s) from time to time at Landlord’s sole discretion; Landlord may give a name to the Project without giving a separate name to the Building.

32. LANDLORD’S LIABILITY.

Tenant represents and warrants that (a) Tenant is duly organized, validly existing and legally authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and (b) the persons executing this Lease are duly authorized to execute and deliver this Lease on behalf of Tenant.

32. NO OFFER.

The submission of the Lease by Landlord to Tenant for examination does not constitute a reservation of or option for the Premises or of any other space within the Building or in other buildings owned or managed by Landlord or its affiliates. This Lease shall become effective as a Lease only upon the execution and legal delivery thereof by both parties hereto.

33. RELOCATION.

Prior to the last two years of the Renewal Term (but not during the initial Term) and only once during the Renewal Term, Landlord, at its sole expense, on at least one hundred fifty (150) days’ prior written notice to Tenant (“Relocation Notice”) may require Tenant to move from the Premises to another suite of substantially comparable size and decor in the Building or in the Project (“New Premises”) in order to permit Landlord to consolidate the Premises with other adjoining space leased or to be leased to another tenant in the Building. In the event of any such relocation, Landlord shall pay all the expenses of preparing and decorating the New Premises so that they will be substantially similar to the Premises and shall also pay the expenses of moving Tenant’s furniture and equipment to the New Premises as well as any other reasonable and necessary costs arising directly from the relocation. In the event the New Premises is larger than the Premises, the Fixed Rent payable by Tenant shall not increase, however, if the New Premises is smaller than the Premises, the Fixed Rent shall be recalculated based on the new square footage. Tenant shall execute any reasonable amendment evidencing the terms of the relocation as Landlord may require in its reasonable discretion.

Landlord shall advise Tenant in the Relocation Notice of the proposed New Premises. If Tenant, in its sole discretion, does not approve of the New Premises, for any reason, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by sending written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Relocation Notice. Such termination shall be effective as of the date proposed by Landlord for such relocation in the Relocation Notice.

34. TENANT FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

Any time and from time to time during the Term but only after an Event of Default has occurred upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written request from Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a current, accurate, complete and detailed balance sheet of Tenant (dated no more than thirty (30) days prior to such delivery), a profit and loss statement, a cash flow summary and all relevant accounting footnotes, all prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Tenant to be a fair and true presentation of Tenant’s current financial position.

38. RENEWAL.

Subject to the existing right of Dechert LLC and Woodcock Washburn, as outlined below, and provided Tenant is neither in default at the time of exercise nor has Tenant ever been in default of any monetary obligations under this Lease aggregating in excess of $150,000, and Tenant or its Permitted Occupant(s) is fully occupying the Premises and the Lease is in full force and effect, Tenant shall have the right to renew this Lease for one term of five (5) years beyond the end of the initial Term (“Renewal Term”). Tenant shall furnish written notice

 

44

of intent to renew within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice from Landlord that an existing tenant has waived its right to take the Premises, failing which, such renewal right shall be deemed waived; time being of the essence. In no event shall Landlord deliver its written notice prior to the last fifteen (15) months of the Term. The terms and conditions of this Lease during each Renewal Term shall remain unchanged except that the annual Fixed Rent for each Renewal Term shall be the greater of (i) the Fixed Rent for the term expiring, and (ii) 95% of Fair Market Rent (as such term is hereinafter defined). All factors regarding Additional Rent shall remain unchanged, and no Tenant Allowance shall be included in the absence of further agreement by the parties. Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall have no right to renew the term hereof other than or beyond the 1 consecutive 5 year term hereinabove described. Landlord and Tenant shall execute an appropriate amendment to this Lease, in form and content satisfactory to each of them, memorializing the extension of the term hereof for the next ensuing Renewal Term.

For purposes of this Lease, “Fair Market Rent” shall mean the base rent, for comparable space, including all free or reduced rent periods, work letters, cash allowances, fit-out periods and other tenant inducement concessions however denominated except as hereinafter provided. In determining the Fair Market Rent, Landlord, Tenant and any appraiser shall take into account applicable measurement and the loss factors, applicable lengths of lease term, differences in size of the space demised, the location of the Building and comparable buildings, amenities in the Building and comparable buildings, the ages of the Building and comparable buildings, differences in base years or stop amounts for operating expenses and tax escalations and other factors normally taken into account in determining Fair Market Rent. The Fair Market Rent shall reflect the level of improvement made or to be made by Landlord to the space and the Recognized Expenses and Taxes under this Lease. If Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on the Fair Market Rent, the Fair Market Rent shall be established by the following procedure: (1) Tenant and Landlord shall agree on a single MAI certified appraiser who shall have a minimum of ten (10) years experience in real estate leasing in the market in which the Premises is located, (2) Landlord and Tenant shall each notify the other (but not the appraiser), of its determination of such Fair Market Rent and the reasons therefor, (3) during the next seven (7) days both Landlord and Tenant shall prepare a written critique of the other’s determination and shall deliver it to the other party, (4) on the tenth (10th) day following delivery of the critiques to each other, Landlord’s and Tenant’s determinations and critiques (as originally submitted to the other party, with no modifications whatsoever) shall be submitted to the appraiser, who shall decide whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s determination of Fair Market Rent is more correct. The determinations so chosen shall be the Fair Market Rent. The appraiser shall not be empowered to choose any number other than the Landlord’s or Tenant’s. The fees of the appraiser shall be paid by the non-prevailing party.

Landlord represents and warrants to the Tenant that (a) it has granted to Dechert, LLP or Woodcock Washburn LLC a right as of the fifth anniversary of Dechert’s rent commencement date to take the 17th floor of the Building of which the Premises is a part and (b) Dechert/ Woodcock is required to exercise its right twelve (12) months prior to such fifth anniversary.

39. KOIZ CONTINGENCY.

Tenant shall have the sole and exclusive right to terminate this Lease (the “Tenant Termination Right”) if, within thirty (30) days following Tenant’s receipt of the fully executed Lease (the “Qualification Outside Termination Date”), time being of the essence: (a) Tenant has not received one of either a (i) confirmation of modification letter or (ii) qualification confirmation letter, from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Community and Economic Development (“DCED”) stating that the date on which initial employment is measured shall be the date of Lease signing for purposes of eligibility for benefits under 73 P.S. § 820.307(b)(1) or (b) Tenant has not received one of either a (i) confirmation of modification letter or (ii) qualification confirmation letter, from DCED stating that (x) the gross revenue of Tenant for purposes of the capital investment test will be measured as the gross revenues of Tenant and (y) the tenant improvements provided by Landlord under this Lease shall be counted for purposes of fulfilling the capital investment made by Tenant for the Ten% capital investment test, each for purposes of eligibility for benefits under 73 P.S. §820.307(b)(2). Tenant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue directly with DCED and to cooperate with Landlord in obtaining such modification / confirmation letters

 

45

from the DCED. For purposes hereof Tenant shall mean Cohen Brothers, LLC and its subsidiaries listed on Schedule 39 attached hereto and they must all be considered together by the DCED as though they were one operating business or separately but all must be eligible for such benefits. Landlord agrees to cooperate in connection with any required or requested applications, letters or other correspondence related to the KOIZ to any state or local agency in connection with the KOIZ. It is understood that Tenant’s efforts in this regard shall include making application for qualification and for modification prior to 5:00 p.m. fifteen (15) business days following the date this Lease is fully executed and delivered, time being of the essence. Tenant’s exercise of the Tenant Termination Right shall be in writing and in order to be effective, shall be delivered to Landlord prior to 5:00 p.m. on the Qualification Outside Termination Date (provided such Qualification Outside Termination Date is a business day and if not, by 5:00 p.m. on the first business day following the Qualification Outside Termination Date). In the event Tenant exercises its Tenant Termination Right to terminate this Lease in accordance with the requirements of this Section, this Lease shall terminate and become null and void and of no further force or effect.

ARTICLE 8

ASSIGNMENT, SUBLETTING & ENCUMBRANCE

8.1 Consent Required. Subtenant shall not assign this Sublease or any interest therein nor shall Subtenant sublet, license, encumber or permit the Subleased Premises or any part thereof to be used or occupied by others, without Sublandlord’s and Master Landlord’s prior written consent. Sublandlord’s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld provided, however, Sublandlord’s withholding of consent shall in all events be deemed reasonable if for any reason Master Landlord’s consent is not obtained. The consent by Sublandlord and Master Landlord to any assignment or subletting shall not waive the need for Subtenant (and Subtenant’s assignee or subtenant) to obtain the consent of Sublandlord and Master Landlord to any different or further assignment or subletting. All conditions and standards set forth in the Master Lease regarding assignments and subletting shall apply, and to the extent there are any Bonus Rents, (Rent paid by such Assignee or SubSubtenant in excess of Rent paid by Subtenant hereunder) subtenant shall provide the Master Landlord with the amounts it is entitled to under the Master Lease.

8.2 Form of Document. Every assignment, agreement, or sublease shall (i) recite that it is and shall be subject and subordinate to the provisions of this Sublease, that the assignee or subtenant assumes Subtenant’s obligation hereunder, that the termination of this Sublease shall at Sublandlord’s sole election, constitute a termination of every such assignment or sublease, and (ii) contain such other terms and conditions customary for a sub-sublease of this type as shall be reasonably requested or provided by Sublandlord’s attorneys.

8.3 No Release of Subtenant. Regardless of Sublandlord’s consent, no subletting or assignment shall release Subtenant of Subtenant’s obligation or alter the primary liability of Subtenant to pay the Rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Subtenant hereunder except to the extent that Sublandlord and Master Landlord consent to such release in writing. The acceptance of Rent by Sublandlord from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Sublandlord of any provision hereof. In the event of default by any assignee, subtenant or any other successor of Subtenant, in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Sublandlord may proceed directly against Subtenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such assignee, subtenant or successor.

8.4 Default. An involuntary assignment shall constitute a default and Sublandlord shall have the right to elect to terminate this Sublease, in which case this Sublease shall not be treated as an asset of Subtenant.

ARTICLE 9

DEFAULT

9.1 Default Described. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a material breach of this Sublease and a default by Subtenant: (i) failure to pay Rent or any other amount within three (3) days after notice the same is past due; (ii) all those items of default set forth in the Master Lease where the obligation is incorporated in this Sublease which remain uncured after the cure period provided in the Master Lease; or (iii) Subtenant’s failure to perform timely and remain uncured after fifteen (15) days written notice of the default, any other material provision of this Sublease.

 

7

9.2 Sublandlord’s Remedies. Sublandlord shall have the remedies set forth in the Master Lease as if Sublandlord is Master Landlord in the event of a default by Subtenant of any obligation of Sublandlord assumed by Subtenant under this Sublease that constitutes a default under Section 19 of the Master Lease. These remedies are not exclusive; they are cumulative and in addition to any remedies now or later allowed by law.

9.3 Subtenant’s Right to Possession Not Terminated. Sublandlord has the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (lessor may continue lease in effect after. lessee’s breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due, if lessee has right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations). Sublandlord may continue this Sublease in full force and effect, and Sublandlord shall have the right to collect rent and other sums when due. During the period Subtenant is in default, Sublandlord may enter the Subleased Premises and relet them, or any part of them, to third parties for Subtenant’s account and alter or install locks and other security devices at the Subleased Premises. Subtenant shall be liable immediately to Sublandlord for all costs Sublandlord incurs in reletting the Subleased Premises, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, brokers’ commissions, expenses of remodeling the Subleased Premises required by the reletting, and like costs. Reletting may be for a period equal to, shorter or longer than the remaining term of this Sublease and rent received by Sublandlord shall be applied to (i) first, any indebtedness from Subtenant to Sublandlord other than rent due from Subtenant; (ii) second, all costs incurred by Sublandlord in reletting, including, without limitation, brokers’ fees or commissions and attorneys fees, the cost of removing and storing the property of Subtenant or any other occupant, and the costs of repairing, altering, maintaining, remodeling or otherwise putting the Subleased Premises into condition acceptable to a new Subtenant or Subtenants; (iii) third, rent due and unpaid under this Sublease. After deducting the payments referred to in this subsection 9.3, any sum remaining from the rent Sublandlord receives from reletting shall be held by Sublandlord and applied in payment of future rent and other amounts as rent and such amounts become due under this Sublease. In no event shall Subtenant be entitled to any excess rent received by Sublandlord.

9.4 All Sums Due and Payable as Rent. Subtenant shall also pay without notice, or where notice is required under this Sublease, immediately upon demand without any abatement, deduction, or setoff, as additional rent all sums, impositions, costs, expenses, and other payments which Subtenant in any of the provisions of this Sublease assumes or agrees to pay, and, in case of any nonpayment thereof, Sublandlord shall have all the rights and remedies provided for in this Sublease or by law in the case of nonpayment of rent.

9.5 No Waiver. Sublandlord may accept Subtenant’s payments without waiving any rights under the Sublease, including rights under a previously served notice of default. No payment by Subtenant or receipt by Sublandlord of a lesser amount than any installment of rent due or other sums shall be deemed as other than a payment on account of the amount due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction; and Sublandlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice of Sublandlord’s right to recover the balance of such Rent or other sum or pursue any other remedy provided in this Sublease, at law or in equity. If Sublandlord accepts payments

 

8

after serving a notice of default, Sublandlord may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Subtenant any further notice or demand. Furthermore, Sublandlord’s acceptance of Rent from Subtenant when the Subtenant is holding over without express written consent does not convert Subtenant’s tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month-to-month tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Sublease shall be implied by any failure of Sublandlord to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision, even if that violation continues or is repeated. Any waiver by Sublandlord or Subtenant of any provision of this Sublease must be in writing. Such waiver shall affect only the provisions specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Sublandlord or Subtenant shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof. No act or conduct of Sublandlord, including, without limitation the acceptance of keys to the Subleased Premises shall constitute acceptance or the surrender of the Subleased Premises by Subtenant before the Expiration Date. Only written notice from Sublandlord to Subtenant of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance or surrender of the Subleased Premises. Sublandlord’s consent to or approval of any act by Subtenant which requires Sublandlord’s consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary Sublandlord’s consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Subtenant.

9.6 Sublandlord Default. For purposes of this Sublease, Sublandlord shall not be deemed in default hereunder unless and until Subtenant shall first deliver to Sublandlord thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, and Sublandlord shall fail to cure said default within said thirty (30) day period, or in the event Sublandlord shall reasonably require in excess of thirty (30) days to cure said default, shall fail to commence said cure with said thirty (30) day period, and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion. If Sublandlord (a) does not commence performance within such thirty (30) calendar day period, or (b) fails to diligently commence and pursue such performance to completion, and the effect of such failure associated with such non-performance materially interferes with Subtenant’s use of the Subleased Premises, Subtenant may perform Sublandlord’s obligation, at Sublandlord’s expense (if the cost of such performance obligations are included in Base Rent), and Sublandlord shall reimburse Subtenant within thirty (30) days of Subtenant’s delivery to Sublandlord of written proof that such performance costs have been paid by Subtenant.

9.7 Notice of Event of Default under Master Lease. Sublandlord shall notify Subtenant of any Event of Default under the Master Lease, or of any other event of which Sublandlord has actual knowledge which will impair Subtenant’s ability to conduct its normal business at the Subleased Premises, as soon as reasonably practicable following Sublandlord’s receipt of notice from Master Landlord of an Event of Default or Sublandlord’s actual knowledge of such impairment.

9.8 No Default of Master Lease. Sublandlord will not voluntarily do, or fail to do, anything which will constitute a default under the Master Lease or permit the Master Lease to be terminated for any reason. Sublandlord hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Subtenant from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) arising from Sublandlord’s breach of any provisions of this Sublease, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 9.8. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease.

For the purposes of this indemnity provision, any acts or omissions of Subtenant or by employees, agents, assignees, contractors or subcontractors of Subtenant (whether or not they are negligent, intentional or unlawful) shall be strictly attributable to Subtenant.

Furthermore, in the event that Subtenant fails to surrender the Premises after such time that (a) the Master Lease has expired and (b) Sublandlord has surrendered its premises under the Master Lease, then the rate for month to month tenancy at sufferance shall be one hundred and fifty percent of any and all Rent due to Master Landlord from Sublandlord under the holdover provisions of the Master Lease.

12.6 Furniture. Subtenant may use certain furniture and fixtures located in the Subleased Premises as set forth on Exhibit C (“Furniture”). Subtenant accepts the Furniture in its “as is” condition and Sublandlord makes no warranty as to the condition of the Furniture or its present or future suitability for Subtenant’s purposes. Upon termination of this Sublease, Subtenant shall return the Furniture to Sublandlord in the same condition as received, ordinary wear and tear excepted conditioned on the obligation of Subtenant to use the Furniture in a careful and proper manner and to clean and repair the Furniture in the manner necessary to maintain the Furniture in the condition it was initially provided to Subtenant, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

(iii) Sublandlord shall also give Subtenant written notice of the actual amount of Operating Costs payable for each calendar year, promptly following Sublandlord’s receipt of the annual statement of such amounts from Landlord, which notice shall include a copy of Landlord’s annual statement. If on the basis of such statement Subtenant owes an amount that is less than the estimated payments for the calendar year just ended, previously paid by Subtenant, Sublandlord shall credit such excess to the next payments of Base Rent coming due or, if the term of this Sublease is about to expire, refund such excess to Subtenant within thirty (30) days after such expiration. If on the basis of such statement Subtenant owes an amount that is more than the estimated payments for the calendar year just ended previously made by Subtenant, Subtenant shall pay the deficiency to Sublandlord within thirty (30) days after delivery of the statement from Sublandlord to Subtenant.

(iv) For partial calendar years during the term of this Sublease, the amount of Operating Costs payable by Subtenant that is applicable to that partial calendar year shall be prorated based on the ratio of the number of days of such partial calendar year falling during the term of this Sublease divided by 365. The obligations of Subtenant and Sublandlord pursuant to this Section 4.b which arise during the term of this Sublease shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease.

(v) The amounts of any Applicable Additional Rent due from Subtenant during the Term of this Sublease shall be paid by Subtenant to Sublandlord within ten (10) days of an itemized invoice from Sublandlord for such amounts.

(vi) For purposes of this Sublease and in addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Sublease, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

(1) “Base Operating Costs” shall mean Operating Costs payable under the Lease during the Base Year.

(2) “Base Year” shall mean the calendar year 2012.

(3) “Subtenant’s Percentage Share” shall mean 14.985%; provided that Sublandlord and Subtenant acknowledge that Subtenant’s Percentage Share has been obtained by dividing the rentable square footage of the Subleased Premises by the total rentable square footage of the Premises and multiplying such quotient by 100. In the event Subtenant’s Percentage Share is changed during a calendar year by reason of a change in the rentable square footage of the Subleased Premises or the Premises, Subtenant’s Percentage Share shall thereupon be adjusted to equal the result obtained by dividing the rentable square footage of the Subleased Premises by the rentable square footage of the Premises and multiplying such quotient by 100, and Subtenant’s Percentage Share shall be determined on the basis of the number of days during such calendar year at each such percentage share.

(c) Payment. Subtenant shall commence to pay Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs from and after January 1, 2013, and to pay Base Rent, Applicable Additional Rent and all other charges hereunder on the Commencement Date, and shall continue to pay Base Rent and Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs in monthly installments on or before the first day of every month thereafter during the Term. The monthly installments

 

3.

of Base Rent and Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs shall be prorated on a per diem basis for the first or last month of the Term if the Commencement Date or Expiration Date is not the first day or last day of a calendar month. For purposes of this Sublease, the word “Rent.” shall mean the Base Rent, Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs, Applicable Additional Rent, and all other charges payable to Sublandlord by Subtenant pursuant to this Sublease.

5. Security Deposit. Concurrent with Subtenant’s execution of this Sublease, Subtenant shall deliver to Sublandlord the sum of $84,800.76 (the “Deposit”) as security for the performance by Subtenant of its obligations under this Sublease. If Subtenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period, the Deposit shall be returned to Subtenant upon the expiration or termination of this Sublease. If Subtenant defaults in respect of any of the terms, provisions, covenants or conditions of this Sublease beyond any applicable notice and cure period, including, but not limited to, payment of Rent, Sublandlord may, but shall not be required to, use, apply or retain the whole or any appropriate part of the Deposit for the payment of any Rent in default or for reimbursement of any reasonable expense that Sublandlord incurs because of Subtenant’s default. If the Deposit is so applied then Subtenant shall, within ten (10) days after Sublandlord’s written request, deposit additional money with Sublandlord sufficient to restore the Deposit to its original amount.

Any alterations consented to shall he subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the Lease (including, without limitation, the provisions of Article 17 of the Lease), and shall be performed in compliance with applicable law.

9. Maintenance. From and after the Commencement Date, Subtenant shall be responsible for all of Sublandlord’s maintenance obligations under the Lease with respect to the Subleased Premises. Subtenant acknowledges that the Building hours are from 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays (Sundays and nationally enacted holidays excepted), and that additional after-hours HVAC services are available to Subtenant upon request and payable by Subtenant at Landlord’s then-current rates.

12. Incorporation of Lease. This Sublease is and shall be at all times subject and subordinate to all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease and to all of the rights of Landlord thereunder.

Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary contained anywhere else in this Sublease, (i) if Sublandlord or Subtenant is obligated to indemnify the other, whether pursuant to the express terms of this Sublease or whether pursuant to the incorporation of terms from the Lease, the indemnifying party shall also be obligated to indemnify Landlord to the same extent and subject to the same limitations; (ii) if Subtenant is obligated to name Sublandlord as an additional insured or loss payee under Subtenant’s insurance policies, whether pursuant to the express terms of this Sublease or whether pursuant to the terms of the Lease that are incorporated herein, Subtenant shall also name Landlord as an additional insured or loss payee, as the case may be, subject to the same limitations or conditions, if any, that may apply with regard to Sublandlord; and (iii) if Landlord’s consent or approval is required under the Lease in a provision of the Lease that is incorporated into this Sublease, Subtenant must obtain the consent or approval of both Sublandlord and Landlord, the granting of which by Landlord shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable Lease provision.

ARTICLE 5. RENT

5.1 Payment.

(a) As consideration for this Lease, Tenant shall pay Landlord all Rent specified in this Lease. Base Rent is payable in advance on the first day of each month of the Term at the Rent Payment Address or such other address specified by Landlord. Additional Rent or sums other than Rent requested by Landlord under the terms of this Lease are payable within ten days of Notice or demand unless a different time period is expressly specified in the Lease. If the Term commences on other than the first clay of the month, the Rent for the first partial month shall be prorated accordingly.

(b) If Tenant exercises its renewal option, the Base Rental rate(s) for the Renewal Term shall be equal to the fair market rate(s), including all concessions, for a five (5) year term for a comparable lease for comparable Class A space located in Fremont/South Lake Union area of the City of Seattle (collectively “Fair Market Rent”). Landlord shall advise Tenant in writing of Landlord’s calculation of Fair Market Rent by no later than ten (10) months prior to the end of the base Lease Term. If Tenant disagrees with such calculation, it shall advise Landlord in writing thereof within twenty (20) days thereafter. If there is a disagreement on such calculation, the parties shall promptly meet to attempt to resolve their differences. If these differences as to Fair Market Rent arc not resolved within a two (2) month period, then the parties shall submit the matter to arbitration in accordance with the terms of Section 5.1(c) so that Fair Market Rent is determined no later than two (2) months prior to the end of the base Term of this Lease.

(c) If the parties are unable to reach agreement on Fair Market Rent during the period specified in Section 5.1(b), then within ten (10) days thereafter either party may advise the other in writing of the name and address of its arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be an appraiser or commercial real estate broker with at least ten (10) years of experience with

commercial rental rates in Fremont/South Lake Union area of the City of Seattle. Within ten (10) business days after receipt of such notice from the initiating party (the “Instigator”) designating its arbitrator, the other party (the “Recipient”) shall give notice to Instigator, specifying the name and address of the person designated by Recipient to act as arbitrator on its behalf who shall be similarly qualified. If Recipient fails to notify Instigator of the appointment of its arbitrator, within or by the time above specified, then the arbitrator appointed by Instigator shall be the arbitrator to determine the issue. The duty of the arbitrator(s) shall be to determine the Fair Market Rent. If the two (2) arbitrators are so chosen the arbitrators so chosen shall meet within ten (10) business days after the second arbitrator is appointed and, if within ten (10) business days after such first meeting the two arbitrators shall be unable to agree promptly upon a determination of Fair Market Rent, they, themselves, shall appoint a third arbitrator, who shall be a competent and impartial person with qualifications similar to those required of the first two arbitrators. If they are unable to agree upon such appointment within five (5) business days after expiration of said ten (10) day period, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the parties themselves, if they can agree thereon, within a further, period of ten (10) business days. If the parties do not so agree, then either party, on behalf of both, may request appointment of such a qualified person by the then presiding judge of King County Superior Court acting in his or her private non judicial capacity, and the other party shall not raise any question as to such judge’s full power and jurisdiction to entertain the application for and make the appointment, and the parties agree to indemnify and hold the presiding judge fully and completely harmless from and against all claims arising out of the presiding judge’s appointment of an arbitrator. The three (3) arbitrators shall decide the dispute, if it has not been previously resolved, by following the procedure set forth in this Section. Where the issue cannot be resolved by agreement between the two arbitrators selected by Landlord and Tenant or settlement between the parties during the course of arbitration, the issue shall be resolved by the three arbitrators in accordance with the following procedure. The arbitrators selected by each of the parties shall state in writing his or her determination of the Fair Market Rent supported by the reasons therefor with counterpart copies to each party. The arbitrators shall arrange for a simultaneous exchange of such proposed resolutions. The role of the third arbitrator shall be to select which of the two proposed resolutions most closely approximates his or her determination of Fair Market Rent. The third arbitrator shall have no right to propose a middle ground or any modification of either of the two proposed resolutions. The resolution he or she chooses as most closely approximating his or her determination shall constitute the decision of the arbitrators and be final and binding upon the parties.

(i) In the event of a failure, refusal or inability of any arbitrator to act, his or her successor shall be appointed by him, but in the case of the third arbitrator, his or her successor shall be appointed in the same manner as provided for appointment of the third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to decide the issue within ten (10) business days after the appointment of the third arbitrator. Any decision in which the arbitrator appointed by Landlord and the arbitrator appointed by Tenant concur shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties. Each party shall pay the fee and expenses of its respective arbitrator and both shall share equally the fee and expenses of the third arbitrator, if any, and the attorneys’ fees and expenses of counsel for the respective parties and of witnesses shall be paid by the respective party engaging such counsel or calling such witnesses.

 

21

The arbitrators shall have the right to consult experts and competent authorities with factual information or evidence pertaining to a determination of Fair Market Rent. The arbitrators shall render their decision and award in writing with counterpart copies to each party. The arbitrators shall have no power to modify the provisions of this Lease.

5.3 Advance Rent. [Intentionally deleted].

5.4 Late Charges; Interest. Tenant acknowledges that late payment of Rent or other sums due under the Lease will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount being extremely difficult and impractical to fix. Such costs include processing and accounting charges, late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any encumbrance covering the Premises, and interest costs. If Landlord does not receive Rent or any other payment due from Tenant five (5) days after Notice from Landlord that such payment is past due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum of ten percent (10%) of such Rent or other payment as a late charge; provided, however, after the first notice in any twelve (12) month period, no further notice shall be required and the late charge shall be imposed after five (5) days. The Parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the cost Landlord will incur by reason of Tenant’s late payment. Accepting any late charge does not waive Tenant’s default with respect to the overdue amount or prevent Landlord from exercising any other rights or remedies available to Landlord. In addition to the late charge, Tenant shall pay interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum on any Rent or other sum not paid by the date due.

Landlord may require that Transferee remit directly to Landlord on a monthly basis, all monies due Transferor by said Transferee.

In the event of default by Transferee, Tenant or any successor of Tenant in the performance of any other terms hereof; Landlord may proceed directly against Transferor without the necessity of exhausting remedies against Transferee or successor. If Tenant requests the consent of Landlord to a Transfer, Tenant will pay Landlord a review fee of $500.00 and shall also reimburse Landlord for all of Landlord’s reasonable attorney’s fees.

8.5 Recapture.

If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease as to the Transfer Premises, an amendment to this Lease shall be executed restating the description of the Premises and reducing Tenant’s obligations for Rent and other charges in proportion to the reduction in rentable area of the Premises. In the event Landlord elects to recapture Tenant may elect to terminate the transfer and retain the premises. In such event, unless the parties otherwise agree, the date, on which the termination shall take effect, shall be the date of the proposed transfer identified in Tenant’s notice. If Landlord elects a whole or partial termination hereunder, Landlord may enter into a

 

25

new lease with the intended Transferee or any other person covering the Transfer Premises on such terms as Landlord and such person may agree. In such event, Tenant shall not be entitled to any portion of the profit that Landlord may realize on account of such termination and reletting.

22.1 Tenant Default. Without limiting or superseding any separate cure rights that Tenant may have under applicable law, the occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an immediate default and breach of this Lease by Tenant (except where cure periods are expressly provided):

(a) Any failure by Tenant to pay when duo the Rent or make any other required payment (cure period of three (3) days) after Notice to Tenant that such payment is past due;

(b) Tenant’s failure to observe or perform any Lease provision where such failure continues for twenty (20) days after Notice thereof to Tenant; provided, if the nature of the default is such that it cannot reasonably be cured within the twenty-day period, Tenant shall not be deemed in default if, in the twenty-day period, Tenant commences to cure and thereafter diligently prosecute the cure to completion;

(c) If at any time during the Term there is a Bankruptcy Event involving Tenant;

(d) Any attempted Transfer in violation of Article 8 or any default by Tenant under its Sublease of other space in the Building; or

(e) Any abandonment of the Premises.

22.2 Landlord Default. Subject to the terms of Article 28 Landlord shall be in default if it fails to observe or perform any of the covenants, conditions or provisions of this Lease for a period longer than thirty (30) days after Notice from Tenant; provided, however, that if more than thirty (30) days is required for performance, Landlord shall not be in default if it commences performance within thirty (30) days of Tenant’s Notice and thereafter completes such performance diligently and within a reasonable time.

ARTICLE 23. REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

23.1 Termination and Damages. In the event of any Tenant default, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord herein or at law or in equity, Landlord shall have the immediate option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder by giving Notice of such intention to terminate. If Landlord shall elect to so terminate this Lease, then Landlord may recover from Tenant:

(a) The worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; plus

(b) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided. As used in Sections 23.1(a) and (b) the “worth at the time of award” is computed by including interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum; plus

(c) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss (computed by discounting such amount at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum;

(d) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for the detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease.

23.2 Personal Property. In the event of default by Tenant, Landlord shall have the right, with or without terminating this Lease, to reenter the Premises and remove all persons and property from the Premises. Such property may be stored in a public warehouse and disposed of at the cost of and for the account of Tenant.

23.3 Recovery of Rent; Relating.

(a) In the event of the abandonment of the Premises by Tenant or if Landlord elects to either reenter as provided for in this Lease or take possession of the Premises either pursuant to legal proceeding or pursuant to any notice provided by law, then if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as provided in subsection (c), below, this Lease shall continue in effect, and Landlord may enforce all its rights and remedies under this Lease, including Landlord’s right to recover all Rent as it becomes due and/or to relet all or part of the Premises for lease term(s), Rent on such terms as are commercially reasonable. Alterations, acts of maintenance or preservation, efforts to relet the Premises, the appointment of a receiver upon initiation of Landlord or other legal proceeding granting Landlord or its agent possession to protect Landlord’s interest under this Lease shall not constitute a termination of Tenant’s right to possession.

(b) If Landlord elects to relet, the Rent received by Landlord from reletting shall be applied in the following order: (1) to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant; (2) to the payment of any cost of reletting, including brokerage fees; (3) to the payment of the cost of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; (4) to the payment of Rent due and unpaid hereunder; and (5) any residue shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder. If the portion of Rent received under clause (b) (4) is less than the Rent payable during that month by Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord when ascertained, any costs and expenses inclined by Landlord in such reletting or in making such alterations and repairs not covered by the Rents received from such reletting.

 

38

(c) No reentry or taking possession of the Premises or any other action under this Section shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a Notice of such intention be given to Tenant or unless the termination thereof be decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any relating without termination by Landlord because of any default by Tenant, Landlord may at any time after such reletting elect to terminate this Lease for any such default.

23.4 No Waiver. Efforts by Landlord to mitigate the damages caused by Tenant’s default in this Lease shall not constitute a waiver of Landlord’s right to recover damages hereunder.

23.5 Curing Defaults. If Tenant fails to repair, maintain, keep clean, or service any of the Premises or fails to perform any other Lease obligation, then after having given Tenant reasonable Notice of any failure and a reasonable opportunity to remedy the failure, which in no case shall exceed twenty (20) days, Landlord may enter upon the Premises and perform or contract for the performance of the repair, maintenance, or other Tenant obligation, and .Tenant shall pay Landlord as Additional Rent all direct and indirect costs incurred in connection therewith.

23.6 Cumulative Remedies. The various rights, options, election powers, and remedies of Landlord contained in this Article and elsewhere in this Lease are cumulative. None of them is exclusive of any others or of any legal or equitable remedy that Landlord might otherwise have in the event of breach or default, and the exercise of one right or remedy by Landlord will not in any way impair its right to any other right or remedy.

23.7 Duty to Mitigate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, each party shall have an affirmative obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages, adverse impacts and costs (and in Landlord’s case, the costs of reletting) in the event of a default, error or delay by the other party; provided, however, in all eases Landlord shall be entitled to lease other vacant space in the Building first before reletting some or all of the Premises following a Tenant default.

ARTICLE 24. SURRENDER OF LEASE

At the termination of this Lease or Tenant’s right of possession, Tenant shall return the Premises to Landlord in good and sanitary order, condition and repair, free of rubble and debris, broom clean, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Tenant shall ascertain from Landlord at least thirty (30) days prior to the termination of this Lease, which Alterations are to be removed in accordance with Article 17 and then Tenant shall forthwith remove the appropriate Alterations and restore the Premises to the condition required herein, entirely at its own expense. At its sole cost and expense, Tenant shall repair all damage to the Premises caused by the removal of trade fixtures or personal property that Tenant is permitted or required to remove.

ARTICLE 25. NOTICES

All notices required or permitted to be given under this Lease (“Notice”), shall be in writing and shall be given or made to the respective party at the address or number set forth in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of this Lease by (1) personal service; (ii) mailing by registered or certified

 

39

mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iii) reputable courier which provides written evidence of delivery. Either Party may change its address for Notice by a Notice sent to the other. Each Notice shall be deemed given or made upon receipt or refusal to receive except that facsimile notices sent on an non-business day or after 5:00 p.m. on a business day shall not be deemed delivered until the next business day.

ARTICLE 26. SUBORDINATION

26.1 Priority of Encumbrances. This Lease shall be subordinate to any ground lease, first mortgage, or first deed of trust now or hereinafter affecting the real property of which the Premises are a part (each a “Security Instrument”) and to any and all advances made on the security thereof and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof. Notwithstanding such subordination, but subject to all of Landlord’s remedies for a default by Tenant and except as otherwise provided by any Lender Carve Outs (as defined in Article 26.3 below), Tenant’s rights under the Lease will be recognized. If a Lender or ground lessor gives Tenant Notice of its election to have this Lease prior to the lien of its Security Instrument, this Lease shall be deemed prior to such Security Instrument, whether this Lease is dated prior or subsequent to the date of said Security Instrument or the date of recording thereof.

26.2 Execution of Documents. Tenant agrees that no documentation other than this Lease is required to evidence such subordination, however, within ten business (10) days after receipt of Notice by Landlord, Tenant agrees to execute any documents reasonably required to effectuate such subordination and any attornment (including non-disturbance provisions) or to make this Lease prior to the lien of any Security Instrument, as the case may be, so long as the same do not materially change the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, except insofar as any of the Lender Carve Outs apply. Failure to comply with this Article within the ten-day period set forth above shall be an immediate breach of this Lease by Tenant, without opportunity to cure, giving Landlord all rights and remedies under Article 23 hereof, as well as a right to damages caused by the loss of a loan, lease or sale which may result from such failure by Tenant.

26.3 Attornment. If a Lender or a ground lessor enforces its remedies provided by law or under the pertinent Security Instrument and succeeds to Landlord’s interest in the Premises (a “Successor-in-Interest”), Tenant shall, upon request of any Successor-in-Interest, automatically become the tenant of said Successor-in-Interest without change in the terms or other provisions of this Lease. The Successor-in-Interest shall not be (1) bound by any payment of Rent for more than thirty (30) days in advance; (ii) bound by any modification or amendment of this Lease to shorten the term or decrease the Base Rent or otherwise materially changes the terms of this Lease without the consent of the Lender or ground lessor; (iii) liable for any act or omission of Landlord or any previous landlord, except to the extent the same constitutes a continuing event of default after such party succeeds to Landlord’s interest; (iv) bound by any obligation of Landlord under the Lease that is not reasonably susceptible to performance by the Successor-in-Interest; (v) subject to any offset, defense, recoupment or counterclaim that Tenant may have as against Landlord or any previous landlord (other than with respect to a breach of Landlord’s obligations under the Lease that continues to exist after the Successor-in-Interest succeeds to Landlord’s interest); or (vi) liable for any deposit with the exception of prepaid rent that Tenant may have made with respect to Landlord or previous landlord that has not been transferred to the Successor-in-Interest (collectively, the “Lender Carve Outs”). Within ten business (10) days

 

40

after Notice of a request by Successor-in-Interest, Tenant shall deliver an executed attornment agreement in a form required by such Successor-in-Interest (including non-disturbance provisions), so long as the same do not materially change the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, except insofar as any of the Lender Carve Outs apply.

ARTICLE 27. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES

27.1 Execution by Tenant. Within ten (10) business days after receipt of Notice by Landlord, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord and entities designated by Landlord an estoppel certificate acknowledging that (i) this Lease is in full force and effect, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms and unmodified (or if modified, specifying the written modification documents); (ii) to the best knowledge of Tenant, no default exists on the part of Landlord or Tenant under this Lease (or, if there are, then stating them); (iii) to the best knowledge of Tenant, there are no events which with the passage of time, or the giving of notice, or both, would create a default under this Lease (or, if there are, then stating them); (iv) no Rent m excess of one month’s Rent has been paid in advance; (v) Tenant has not sold, assigned, transferred, mortgaged or pledged this Lease or the Rent nor has it received notice of same (or, if it has, then so stating); (vi) to the best knowledge of Tenant, Tenant has no defense, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against Landlord (or, if it has, then so stating), and (vii) such other matters as Landlord may reasonably request (so long as such other statements do not materially change the rights and/or duties of the parties). Landlord, any Lender, or any prospective purchaser of the Building or Complex may rely upon such estoppel certificate. Failure to comply with this Article within the ten-day period set forth above shall mean that Tenant is deemed to have made the representations set forth in items (i) through (vii) above.

27.2 Financing, Sale or Transfer. If Landlord desires to finance, refinance, sell, or otherwise transfer the Premises, Building or Complex, or any part thereof, Tenant agrees, within ten (10) business days of request therefor by Landlord, to deliver to Landlord and any lender, prospective buyer or transferee designated by Landlord financial statements of Tenant and any parent company as may be reasonably required by such party. All such financial statements shill be received by Landlord in confidence and shall be used only for the purposes herein set forth.

ARTICLE 28. LENDER PROTECTION

Tenant agrees to give any Lender, by registered mail, a copy of any notice of default served upon Landlord, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been given Notice of the address of such Lender, either pursuant to an estoppel certificate, subordination agreement or otherwise. Tenant agrees that if Landlord fails to cure the default within the time provided for in this Lease, Lender shall have an additional thirty (30) days within which to cure the default or, if the default cannot be cured within that time, then such additional time as may be necessary if, within the thirty (30) days, Lender has commenced and is diligently pursuing the remedies necessary to cure the default (including commencement of foreclosure proceedings, if necessary). This Lease shall not be terminated while such remedies are being pursued.

 

41

ARTICLE 29. BANKRUPTCY

If at any time during the Term there is a Bankruptcy Event, the following provisions shall apply:

(a) Any receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors (“assignee”), trustee of any kind, or Tenant as debtor-in-possession (“debtor”) shall either expressly assume or reject this Lease within sixty days following the assignment to the assignee or the filing of the pleading initiating the receivership or bankruptcy case. All such parties agree that they will not seek Court permission to extend such time for assumption or rejection. Failure to assume or reject in the time set forth herein shall mean that the Lease may be terminated at Landlord’s option. Rejection of the Lease shall be a default under the Lease.

(b) If the Lease is assumed by a debtor, receiver, assignee or trustee, such party shall immediately after such assumption (1) cure any default or provide adequate assurances that defaults will be promptly cured; (2) pay Landlord for actual pecuniary loss or provide adequate assurances that compensation will be made for such loss; and (3) provide adequate assurance of future performance.

(c) Where a default exists under the Lease, the party assuming the Lease may not require Landlord to provide services or supplies incidental to the Lease before its assumption by such trustee or debtor, unless Landlord is compensated under the terms of the Lease for such services and supplies provided before the assumption of such Lease.

(d) Landlord reserves all remedies available to Landlord in Article 23 or at law or in equity in respect of a Bankruptcy Event by Tenant, to the extent applicable law permits such remedies.

(e) Tenant agrees that all attorney’s fees and costs incurred by Landlord in dealing with a bankruptcy of Tenant are an actual pecuniary loss of Landlord and Tenant agrees that it shall pay all such costs and expenses in the event of any assumption or Transfer of the Lease.

45

Landlord, on which Landlord is willing to lease the RFO Space. To exercise the right of first opportunity, Tenant must within five (5) business days after receipt of the Offer Notice give Landlord notice of Tenant’s desire to enter into negotiations with Landlord to lease such space at Market Rent and offered terms and otherwise on terms mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant (the “Negotiation Notice”). If Tenant gives the Negotiation Notice within such five (5) business day period, then Landlord and Tenant shall promptly enter into good faith negotiations to lease such space at Market Rent and otherwise on terms mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant. If Tenant fails to give the Negotiation Notice within such space within five (5) business days after Tenant gives the Negotiation Notice, then the right of first opportunity shall immediately terminate as to the RFO Space, and Landlord shall be free to lease the RFO Space, or portions thereof, to third parties. The term “vacant and available for lease” as used in this Section shall mean that such space has been vacated by the previous tenant and is not subject to any prior options to expand, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal held by any other tenant or third party. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord may elect to enter into new lease(s) with existing tenant(s) of part or all of the RFO Space and that if Landlord does so, then the portion of the RFO space occupied by such existing tenant(s) shall not be deemed vacant and available for lease, Landlord shall only be obligated to submit an Offer Notice to Tenant under this Section 30.27 or to lease RFO Space to Tenant under this Section 30.27 if: (a) Tenant is not in default under this Lease and would not be but for the passage of time or the giving of notice; (b) Tenant has not previously been in default under this Lease beyond the applicable cure period; (c) Tenant has not previously assigned this Lease or sublet any part of the Premises individually or in the aggregate, individually or in the aggregate in excess of 6,700 square feet; (d) this Lease is in full force and effect; (e) Tenant’s or Guarantor’s net worth and/or net current assets are not below the level which existed at the time this Lease was signed; and (f) Tenant is not the subject of a petition in bankruptcy, has not made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or has not had a receiver appointed with respect to it or to a material portion of its assets.

30.28 Communication Device. Tenant shall have the right to install an antenna or satellite “dish” or similar device for the reception and transmission of signals of a size approved by Landlord (“Device”) on the roof of the Complex in a location selected by Landlord, but only for Tenant’s own use and only in accordance with the terms of this Section 30.28. The Device shall be installed, maintained, operated, repaired and removed at the end of the Term, or its earlier termination, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, Tenant shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and ordinances relating to the installation, use, maintenance, repair or removal of the Device and shall not permit it to be operated in a manner which will interfere with other tenant’s Devices. The plans for the Device and its location shall be provided to Landlord for its review and approval at least thirty (30) days prior to its installation of the Device, and Tenant shall comply with Landlord’s directions with regard to its installation, use, maintenance, repair and removal. Tenant shall install the Device in such manner as will not reduce the coverage afforded Landlord under its roof warranty and shall reimburse Landlord for all of Landlord’s costs reasonably incurred in connection with the installation, use, maintenance, repair or removal of the Device within ten (10) days of Tenant’s receipt of each invoice thereafter. If Landlord so requires, Tenant shall at its sole expense provide a double membrane over the roof to be used as a walkway for Device installation, service, maintenance and removal. Tenant shall remove the Device as and when necessary for Landlord’s roof maintenance work and at the end of the Lease term or upon its earlier termination and shall repair any damage resulting from its removal. Tenant’s obligations under this Section shall survive termination of this Lease.

WORK LETTER

1. Improvements Allowance.

1.1 Allowance. Landlord shall provide Tenant with an allowance of Forty and 89/100 Dollars ($40.89) per RSF of Premises area (the “Allowance”). Landlord agrees to reimburse Tenant for the Cost of Tenant’s Work, as hereinafter defined, up to the total of the Allowance, in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.

(a) Payments to contractors and subcontractors.

(b) Fees for building permits and inspections;

(c) Fees of Tenant’s engineers, surveyors, architects, attorneys and others providing professional or other services in connection with the construction of Tenant’s Work or the supervision thereof;

(d) Other direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with Tenant’s Work; and

The Cost of Tenant’s Work does not include the cost of acquiring, delivering or installing Tenant’s furniture, fixtures or equipment.

1.3 Disbursement. Landlord shall disburse directly to Tenant, the Cost of Tenant’s Work, but not in excess of the Allowance within thirty (30) days following receipt of a schedule reflecting such costs, together with paid invoices supporting such costs, and satisfaction of all of the following conditions, but in no event earlier than July 16, 2010:

EXPENSES, TAXES AND INSURANCE COSTS

1. Definitions.

1.1 “Excluded Costs” are all of the following: Capital Costs (to the extent not permitted by Section 2.5); depreciation; principal or interest payments of mortgage and other debts of Landlord; the cost of repairs or other work to the extent Landlord is reimbursed by insurance or condemnation proceeds; costs in connection with leasing space in the Building, including brokerage commissions, lease concessions, rental abatements and construction allowances granted to specific tenants; costs incurred in connection with the sale, financing or refinancing of the Complex; fines, interest and penalties incurred due to the late payment of Taxes or Expenses; or any penalties or damages that Landlord pays to tenants in the Complex under their respective leases; and excluding the following:

(i) Property management fees in excess of four percent (4%) of the Base Rent payable under the Lease;

(ii) Executive’s salaries above the grade of general manager;

(iii) Expenditures which under generally accepted accounting principles are considered capital expenditures, except to the extent of Capital Costs defined in Section 2.5 of the Lease;

(iv) Consulting fees, marketing fees, advertising and promotional expenditures;

(v) Legal, accounting and auditing fees, other than legal, accounting and auditing fees reasonably incurred in connection with the maintenance and operation of the Property or in connection with the preparation of the statements required pursuant to the Lease;

(vi) Rents payable in connection with any ground or underlying lease of all or any portion of the Property;

(vii) Penalties due to any violation of law by Landlord or other tenants;

(viii) Costs of preparing tenant space for tenant occupancy;

(ix) Costs of any utilities, services, or capital improvements relating to all or any portion of the Property which were paid directly by Tenant or any other tenant;

(x) Damages incurred by Landlord for any of its defaults under any leases or contracts relating to the Building or Complex, or breaches of law;

(xi) Premium rates paid on service or other contracts, except in an emergency; and

(xii) Landlord’s general administrative overhead.

 

61

1.2 “Pro Rata Percent” is a fraction the numerator of which is the Rentable Area of the Premises and the denominator of which is the Rentable Area of the Building. Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent as of the Commencement Date is specified in Section 1.11 of the Lease, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent will be recalculated as required effective at the commencement of any period to which the calculation is applicable in this Lease. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent as to certain expenses may be calculated differently to yield a higher percentage share for Tenant as to certain expenses in the event Landlord permits other tenants in the Complex to directly incur such expenses rather than have Landlord incur the expense in common for the Complex (such as, by way of illustration, wherein a tenant performs its own janitorial services). In such case Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent of the applicable expense shall be calculated as having as its denominator the Rentable Area of the Building less the Rentable Area of tenants who have incurred such expense directly. Furthermore, in the event Tenant consumes extraordinary amounts of any provided utility or other service as determined in Landlord’s good faith judgment, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent for such utility or service may, at Landlord’s election, be based on usage as opposed to Rentable Area of the Building, that is, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent of such a utility or service would be calculated as having as its denominator the total usage of such utility or service in the Complex (or Building as the case may be), and having as its numerator Tenant’s usage of such utility or service, as determined by Landlord. If Tenant, with Landlord’s consent, which Landlord may grant or withhold in its arbitrary judgment, incurs such expenses directly, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent will be calculated specially so that expenses of the same character which are incurred by Landlord for the benefit of other tenants in the Complex shall not be prorated to Tenant. If repairs are required for systems exclusively serving the Premises (whether within or outside of said Premises) and Landlord historically has not passed through such costs as Operating Cost borne by all tenants of the Building or Complex, then Tenant shall pay one hundred percent of such repair costs; provided however, if the costs are of a capital nature they shall be amortized and charged to Tenant in the same way that Capital Costs are amortized and charged under the Lease.

2. Additional Rent.

2.1 Operating Costs. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent of the Operating Costs for the Building or Complex, as the case may be, for any Lease Year, calculated by multiplying the Pro Rata Percent times (a) the greater of either (i) actual Operating Costs; or (ii) Operating Costs computed as if the Building or Complex were at least ninety-five percent (95%) occupied and operational for the whole Lease Year. If any Lease Year of less than twelve months is included within the Term, the amount payable by Tenant for such period shall be prorated on a per diem basis (using a 360-day year).

2.2 Personal Property, Gross Receipts, Leasing Taxes. This Section is intended to deal with taxes directly attributed to Tenant or this transaction, as distinct from Taxes attributable to the Complex which are to be allocated among various tenants and others and which are included in Operating Costs. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all taxes required to be paid by Landlord, whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto, which are: (a) upon, measured by, or reasonably attributable to (i) the cost or value of Tenant’s equipment, furniture, fixtures and other personal property located in the Premises or (ii) if separately assessed by the tax assessor, the cost or value of any Leasehold Improvements made in or to the Premises by or for Tenant, other than Building Standard Work, regardless of

 

62

whether title to such improvements shall be in Tenant or Landlord; (b) upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion thereof to the extent such taxes are not included as Taxes and are not a gross receipts -tax or Business and Occupations tax, provided, however, if after the date of this Lease, any new taxes or assessments are imposed that are based upon rents received from Tenant and are not otherwise included in Taxes, Landlord shall be entitled to collect reimbursement for such taxes or assessments from Tenant; and (c) upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises.

2.3 Refuse Disposal. Tenant shall pay Landlord, within ten days of being billed therefor, for the removal from the Common Area, the Complex, or the Building of any amounts of refuse or rubbish that Tenant has generated in excess of amounts typically generated by other tenants of the Complex or of typical types of waste. However, Landlord shall have no responsibility for the removal of medical or dental wastes which shall be wholly Tenant’s responsibility as detailed in the Lease.

2.4 Method of Payment. Any Additional Rent payable by Tenant under Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 hereof shall be paid as follows, unless otherwise provided: (a) During the Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord monthly in advance with its payment of Base Rent, one-twelfth of the amount of such Additional Rent as estimated by Landlord in advance, in good faith, to be due from Tenant during the Lease Year; and (b) annually, within ten business days after receipt of Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement. As soon as is reasonably possible after the expiration of each Lease Year, Landlord shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Tenant a comparative statement setting forth (1) the Operating Costs for such Lease Year, and (2) the amount of any other Additional Rent as determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section (“Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement”). If the aggregate amount of estimated Additional Rent payments made by Tenant in any Lease Year is less than the Additional Rent due for such year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent the amount of such deficiency. Any delay in Landlord delivering the Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement shall not relieve Tenant from its obligation to pay any Additional Rent. If the aggregate amount of such Additional Rent payments made by Tenant in any Lease Year of the Term should be greater than the Additional Rent due for such year, Landlord will apply the amount of such excess to the next succeeding installments of Base Rent or such Additional Rent due hereunder; and if there is any such excess for the last year of the Term, the amount thereof will be refunded by Landlord to Tenant, within 45 days after the expiration of the Lease, to the extent Tenant is not otherwise in default under the terms of this Lease.

3. Audit Rights. Not later than 120 days of receiving Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement, Tenant may give Landlord written notice (“Review Notice”) that Tenant intends to review Landlord’s records of the Operating Costs for the Lease Year to which the statement applies. Within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Review Notice, Landlord shall make all pertinent records available for inspection that are reasonably necessary for Tenant to conduct its review. If any records are maintained at a location other than the management office for the Building, Tenant may either inspect the records at such other location or pay for the reasonable cost of copying and shipping the records, If Tenant retains an agent to review Landlord’s records, the agent must be with a CPA firm licensed to do business in the State. No audit may be

 

63

conducted wholly or partially on a contingent fee basis. Tenant is solely responsible for all costs, expenses and fees incurred for the audit, unless the Operating Costs were overstated by more than 5% in which case Landlord shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket cost of the audit. Within ninety (90) days after the records are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to give Landlord written notice (an “Objection Notice”) stating in reasonable detail any objection to Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement for that Lease Year. If Tenant fails to give Landlord an Objection Notice within the 90-day period or fails to provide Landlord with a Review Notice within the 120-day period described above, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement and shall be barred from raising any claims regarding the Expenses for that Lease Year. The records obtained by Tenant shall be treated as confidential. In no event shall Tenant be permitted to examine Landlord’s records or to dispute any Operating Cost Statement unless Tenant shall not be in default under this Lease.

GUARANTY OF LEASE

As an inducement to FREMONT LAKE UNION CENTER, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Landlord”) to enter into that Lease dated                     , 2009 which covers certain premises located in the Plaza Building at 701 North 34th Street, Seattle, Washington (the “Lease”) with CUTTER & BUCK INC., a Washington corporation (“Tenant”), the undersigned (hereinafter “Guarantor”), being financially interested in Tenant and benefiting from the Lease, hereby guarantees to Landlord the full and prompt payment of all sums, including, but not limited to, the rent, taxes, insurance, utility charges and any and all other sums and charges payable by the Tenant under the Lease, including during the Renewal Term, if extended, and the full and prompt performance and observance of all the covenants, terms conditions and agreements therein provided to be performed and observed by Tenant. Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees to and with Landlord that if Tenant or its successors or assigns at any time defaults in the payment of any such sum or in the performance of any of the terms, covenants, provisions or conditions contained in the Lease and such default is not cured within the applicable cure period, Guarantor will immediately pay such sum or will forthwith perform and fulfill such terms, covenants and conditions and agreements, and will immediately pay to Landlord, its successors and assigns all damages that may arise as a consequence of any default by Tenant under the Lease, including without limitation, all reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Landlord. This is an absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment and performance.

The obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of Tenant, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor, regardless of whether an action is brought against Tenant and regardless of whether Tenant is joined in such action or actions. The liability of Guarantor hereunder is primary and shall not be affected or diminished by any transfer, of Tenant’s interest in the Lease.

Guarantor authorizes Landlord, without notice or demand and without affecting Guarantor’s liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) accelerate or otherwise change the time for payments under or otherwise change the terms of, the Lease or any part thereof, by agreement with Tenant; (b) release or substitute any one or more guarantors; (c) modify or alter the liability of Tenant under the Lease; or (d) to settle or compromise any claim of Landlord against Tenant. Landlord may assign the Lease and/or this Guaranty in whole or in part, without notice and without in any manner affecting Guarantor’s obligations hereunder.

Guarantor waives any right to require Landlord to (a) proceed against Tenant; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Tenant; or (c) pursue any other remedy in Landlord’s power whatsoever. Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Tenant or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Tenant. Until all obligations of Tenant to Landlord under the Lease shall have been fully paid and performed, Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, and waives any right to enforce any remedy which Landlord now has or may hereafter have against Tenant, and waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by Landlord, Except for the right to receive notice of default as set forth below, and the cure periods provided to Tenant under the Lease, Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, notices of

 

68

nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness and all other notices of every kind and nature to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled as a matter of law.

Any indebtedness of Tenant now or hereafter held by Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the indebtedness of Tenant to Landlord and such indebtedness of Tenant to Guarantor, if Landlord so requests, shall be collected, enforced and received by Guarantor as a trustee for Landlord and be paid over to Landlord on account of the indebtedness of Tenant to it, but without reduction or affecting in any manner the liability of Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Until such time as the Lease has been paid and performed in full, Guarantor agrees not to exercise any rights any of them may now or hereafter acquire against Tenant (whether by subrogation, reimbursement, or otherwise) arising out of payments to Landlord hereunder. Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes in favor of Landlord and Tenant any claim or right to payment Guarantor may now have or hereafter have or acquire against Tenant, by subrogation or otherwise.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Guaranty, in the event Guarantor (i) sells or transfers (including without limitation a transfer resulting from a sale of stock or a merger, consolidation or reorganization) a controlling ownership interest in Tenant to a Qualified Transferee (as defined below), and provides to Landlord a substitute guaranty executed by such Qualified Transferee in substantially the same form, and with the same legal effect, as this Guaranty, or (ii) provides to Landlord a substitute for this Guaranty in the form of a letter of credit in a form, from an issuer and in an amount acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion, then in either case this Guaranty shall be deemed terminated and Guarantor shall be released from all further liability under this Guaranty and/or the Lease accruing after the date of the substitution. The term “Qualified Transferee” shall mean any person or entity having an audited Tangible Net Worth (as defined below) not less than 550,300,000 Swedish Krona, being the Tangible Net Worth of Guarantor as of the date hereof. The term “Tangible Net Worth” shall Mean the excess of total assets over total liabilities, in each case as determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), excluding, however, from the determination of total assets all assets which would be classified as intangible assets under IFRS, including goodwill, customer relations, licenses, patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights and franchises.

Guarantor agrees that it is not necessary for Landlord to inquire into the powers of Tenant or any officers, directors or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder. Guarantor warrants that this Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary authorities.

The Guarantor agrees to assume full responsibility for keeping itself informed as to the financial condition of Tenant and all other circumstances bearing upon risk of non-payment or non-performance of the Obligations which diligent inquiry would reveal with Lender to have no duty to advise the Guarantor of any information, whether known to Landlord or otherwise, regarding the financial or other condition of Tenant.

 

69

This Guaranty shall bind the successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assigns of Landlord. In the event that the Lease is assigned or transferred by Landlord (“Landlord Assignment”), this Guaranty may likewise be assigned and/or endorsed by Landlord to the assignee of the Lease (assignment of the Lease to also be deemed to be an assignment of this Guaranty), and in such event, the holder of this Guaranty may enforce this Guaranty as if such holder had been originally named as the Landlord hereunder.

This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceedings against Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty may be brought in the courts of the State of Washington sitting in King County, Washington, or in any United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and by Guarantor’s execution and delivery of this Guaranty, Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to each such jurisdiction and hereby irrevocably waives any and all objections which Guarantor may have as to venue in any of such courts.

Guarantor agrees to pay all costs of enforcement of this Guaranty, including Landlord’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and all costs and expenses of suit and in preparation therefor and on appeal therefrom. Any sums due hereunder which are not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate specified for delinquent payments in the lease.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect and shall be unaffected by any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of Tenant or any successor or assign of Tenant or any disaffirmance or rejection of the Lease by a trustee of Tenant or any trustee of any successor or assign of Tenant.

The Guarantor hereby waives its right to a jury trial with respect to any legal proceeding involving or enforcing this Guaranty.

Landlord agrees to provide Guarantor with a copy (if any written notice of default given by Landlord to Tenant.

LANDLORD’S CONSENT TO SUBLEASE

FREMONT LAKE UNION CENTER LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, being landlord (“Landlord”) under terms of a lease dated October 21, 2009 (the “Master Lease”) consents to the foregoing Sublease (the “Sublease”) from CUTTER & BUCK INC., a Washington corporation, tenant under the Master Lease (“Tenant”), to TABLEAU SOFTWARE, INC., a Delaware corporation, as sublessee (“Sublessee”), subject expressly to Tenant’s and Sublessee’s written agreement to all of the following:

1. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to modify, waive or affect (i) any of the provisions, covenants or conditions in the Master Lease, (ii) any of Tenant’s obligations under the Master Lease or those of any guarantor (“Guarantor”) of Tenant’s obligations under the Master Lease, or (iii) any rights or remedies of Landlord under the Master Lease or otherwise or to enlarge or increase Landlord’s obligations or Tenant’s rights under the Master Lease or otherwise or be construed to waive any present or future breach or default on the part of Tenant or Sublessee under the Master Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord hereby (i) consents to Sublessee installing, at Sublessee’s cost, building-standard signage at the elevator bank of the floor on which the Subleased Premises is located, and (ii) conceptually approves Sublessee installing, at Sublessee’s sole cost, the improvements within, to and servicing the Subleased Premises (the “Subtenant Improvements”) described on Exhibit C-1 attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein, subject to Sublessee first obtaining Landlord’s approval of the plans and specifications therefor and otherwise complying in full with the requirements of Article 17 of the Master Lease with respect thereto and not permitting occupancy of the Subleased Premises at a level which will exceed the designed HVAC system level for the Building or Premises.

2. Nothing contained herein shall release or discharge Tenant or Guarantor from any liability under the Master Lease, and Tenant and Guarantor shall remain primarily liable and responsible for the full performance and observance of all of the provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in the Master Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed and observed. Any breach or violation of any provisions of the Master Lease by Sublessee shall be deemed to be and shall constitute a default by Tenant in fulfilling such provision. Tenant shall be obligated to pay Landlord upon demand all reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs resulting from disputes or lawsuits in which Landlord is involved as a consequence of disagreements between Tenant and Sublessee or the bankruptcy or insolvency of Sublessee.

3. The Sublease is subordinate to the Master Lease, and any termination of the Master Lease shall result in an automatic termination of the Sublease unless otherwise first agreed in writing by Landlord.

4. Sublessee shall have no right to enforce Tenant’s rights under the Master Lease, all of which enforcement rights are personal to Tenant.

5. Landlord’s consent shall not be construed as a consent by Landlord to any further sublease. Landlord’s consent shall be required for any amendment or modification of the Sublease. Sublessee’s interest under the Sublease may not be assigned, transferred or encumbered, nor shall the Premises, or any part thereof, be further sublet without the express prior written consent of Landlord.

 

73

6. Tenant shall be and continue to remain liable for all bills and charges incurred by or imposed under the Master Lease for services rendered and materials supplied to the Premises during the term of the Master Lease. While Tenant consents thereto, Landlord’s acceptance of a payment from Sublessee shall not be deemed an attornment by Sublessee to Landlord or to release Tenant from liability.

7. Upon the expiration or any earlier termination of the term of the Master Lease, or in case of the surrender of the Master Lease by Tenant to Landlord, except as provided in the following sentence, the Sublease and its term shall expire and come to an end as of the effective date of such expiration, termination, or surrender and Sublessee shall vacate the subleased premises on or before such date. If the Master Lease shall expire or terminate during the term of the Sublease for any reason other than condemnation or destruction by fire or other cause, or if Tenant shall surrender the Master Lease to Landlord during the term of the Sublease, Landlord, in its sole discretion (upon written notice given to Tenant and Sublessee not more than thirty (30) days after the effective date of such expiration, termination or surrender and without any additional or further agreement of any kind on the part of Sublessee), may elect to continue the Sublease with the same force and effect as if Landlord as lessor and Sublessee as lessee had entered into a lease as of such effective date for a term equal to the then unexpired term of the Sublease and containing the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Sublease. In such event, Sublessee shall attorn to Landlord and Landlord and Sublessee shall have the same rights, obligations and remedies thereunder as were had by Tenant and Sublessee thereunder prior to such effective date, respectively, except that in no event shall Landlord be (a) liable for any act or omission by Tenant, (b) subject to any offsets or defenses which Sublessee had or might have against Tenant, (c) bound by any rent or additional rent or other payment paid by Sublessee to Tenant in advance, (d) obligated to honor any right of first opportunity, right of first refusal, or expansion rights granted to Sublessee under the Sublease, or (e) bound by any amendment to the Sublease not consented to by Landlord. Upon expiration of the Sublease pursuant to the provisions of the first sentence of this Paragraph 7, in the event of the failure of Sublessee to vacate the subleased premises as therein provided, Landlord shall be entitled to all the rights and remedies available to a landlord against a tenant holding over after the expiration of a term.

8. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within five (5) business days of demand for Landlord’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with the Sublease and this Consent, which sums shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from due date until paid.

9. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within five (5) business days of demand for all of Landlord’s costs and expenses incurred in connection with its review of Sublessee’s proposed alterations of, and improvements to, the Subleased Premises and the monitoring of such work.

10. Sublessee shall concurrently herewith provide Landlord with a certificate evidencing that Sublessee has in place the insurance required of Tenant by the terms of the Master Lease.

SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

 

This Sublease Agreement (“Sublease”) is made effective as of the 7th day of October, 2004, (the “Effective Date”) by and between Blue Coat Systems, a Delaware corporation (“Sublessor”), and Infoblox Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sublessee”). Sublessor agrees to sublease to Sublessee, and Sublessee agrees to sublease from Sublessor, those certain premises situated in the City of Sunnyvale, County of Santa Clara, State of California, consisting of approximately 45,823 square feet of space known as 475-477 Potrero Avenue, more particularly set forth on Exhibit “A” hereto (the “Subleased Premises”).

 

ARTICLE 1

 

MASTER LEASE AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

 

1.1 Subordinate to Master Lease. Except as specifically set forth herein, this Sublease is subject and subordinate to all of the terms and conditions of the lease (the “Lease”) dated as of March 20, 2001, between Sunnyvale VIII Trust, a Maryland business trust (“Master Lessor”) and CacheFlow Inc., a Delaware corporation, now known as Blue Coat Systems, as “Lessee”. The Lease is sometimes referred to herein as the “Master Lease”. Sublessee hereby assumes and agrees to perform the obligations of Lessee under the Master Lease as more particularly set forth hereafter and Sublessor agrees to perform the obligations of Lessee under the Lease to the extent not assumed by Sublesee under this Sublease. Unless otherwise defined, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings as given them in the Master Lease. A copy of the Master Lease is attached hereto as Exhibit “A” and incorporated herein by this reference. With respect to the obligations assumed by Sublessee, Sublessee shall not commit or permit to be committed any act or omission which would violate any term or condition of the Master Lease. With respect to the obligations assumed by Sublessee, Sublessee shall neither do nor permit anything to be done which would cause the Master Lease to be terminated or forfeited by reason of any right of termination or forfeiture reserved or vested in Master Lessor under the Master Lease. Sublessee and Sublessor shall each indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against all liability, judgments, costs, demands, claims, and damages of any kind whatsoever (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and court costs) by reason of any failure on the part of Sublessee to perform any of the obligations of Lessee under the Master Lease which Sublessee and Sublessor are obligated hereunder to perform. In the event of the termination of Sublessor’s interest as Lessee under the Master Lease by Master Lessor, then this Sublease shall terminate automatically upon such termination without any liability of Master Lessor or Sublessor to Sublessee. If there is any right to terminate the Lease on the part of Lessee under the Master Lease, to the extent Master Lessor consents to the assignment by Sublessor of such right to terminate, such right is hereby assigned to Sublessee and only Sublessee, and not Sublessor, may exercise such right. Sublessee represents and warrants to Sublessor that it has read and is familiar with the Master Lease.

 

1.2 Applicable Provisions. All of the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease as they may apply to the Subleased Premises, except those directly contradicted by the terms and conditions contained in this document, and specifically except for Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6(e), 8, 9, 13(a), 21, 29, 30, 31, 36, 41, 42, 43, 51, Exhibits C, and C-1 through C-3, and

Exhibit D are incorporated herein and shall be terms and conditions of this Sublease (with each reference therein to “Landlord” or “Lessor”, “Tenant” or “Lessee” and “Lease” to be deemed to refer to Sublessor, Sublessee, and Sublease, respectively, as appropriate except the following provisions that are incorporated herein, the reference to Landlord or Lessor shall mean Master Lessor only: Sections 19 and 10(e)-(f)), and along with all of the following terms and conditions set forth in this document, shall constitute the complete terms and conditions of this Sublease.

 

1.3 Obligations of Sublessor. The only services or rights to which Sublessee is entitled hereunder from Master Lessor are those to which Sublessor is entitled under the Master Lease, and for all such services and rights Sublessee shall look solely to the Master Lessor under the Master Lease, and the obligations of Sublessor hereunder shall be limited to using its reasonable good faith efforts to obtain the performance by Master Lessor of its obligations. Should Sublessor be unable to obtain any performance by Master Lessor, Sublessor hereby assigns to Sublessee the right to seek to obtain such performance, such right to include legal action against Master Lessor. Sublessor shall have no liability to Sublessee or any other person for damage of any nature whatsoever as a result of the failure of Master Lessor to perform said obligations except for Master Lessor’s termination of the Sublessor’s interest as Lessee under the Master Lease in the event of Sublessor’s breach of the Master Lease, and Sublessee shall indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any and all claims and liability whatsoever for any such damage (unless such damage is caused by Sublessor’s breach of the Master Lease) including, without limitation, all costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in defending against same. With respect to any obligation of Sublessee to be performed under this Sublease other than a monetary obligation, when the Master Lease grants Sublessor a specific number of days to perform its obligations thereunder, Sublessee shall have two (2) fewer days to perform, provided that if Sublessor is in receipt of a notice of default from Master Lessor, Sublessor agrees to promptly transmit such notice by facsimile to Sublessee, attention: Eric Carlsen at (408) 716-4400 and Sublessee shall have two (2) fewer days than the number of days specified in such notice or the number of days to perform as provided in the Master Lease. With respect to any monetary obligation of Sublessee to be performed under this Sublease, Sublessee shall make the payments on or before the date that such payment is due. With respect to approval required to be obtained from “Landlord” under the Master Lease, such consent must be obtained from Master Lessor and Sublessor and the approval of Sublessor may be withheld if Master Lessor’s consent is not obtained.

ARTICLE 3

3.1 Rent. Commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor each month during the term of this Sublease, rent in the amount of Twenty Three Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty Seven and 96/100 Dollars ($23,827.96), in advance, on execution hereof for the first month and on or before the first of each month thereafter (“Base Rent”). Rent for partial months at the commencement or termination of this Sublease shall be prorated. Rent shall be paid to the Sublessor at its business address noted herein, or at any other place Sublessor may from time to time designate by written notice mailed or delivered to Sublessee.

If Sublessee fails to pay Rent or any other sums as and when due hereunder, or otherwise defaults and/or fails to perform with respect to any provision of this Sublease, Sublessor may (but shall not be obligated to) use, apply, or retain all or any portion of said deposit for payment of any sum for which Sublessee is obligated or which will compensate Sublessor for any loss or damage which Sublessor may suffer thereby and to which Sublessor may be entitled by law, including, without limitation, any damage that will result in the future through the term of the Sublease, to repair damage to the Subleased Premises, to clean the

 

-3-

Subleased Premises at the end of the term or for any loss or damage caused by the act or omission of Sublessee or Sublessee’s officers, agents, employees, independent contractors or invitees. Sublessee waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1950.7 and all other provisions of law now in force or that become in force after the date of execution of this Sublease that provide that Sublessor may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of Rent, to repair damage caused by Sublessee or to clean the Subleased Premises. Any such use, application, or retention shall not constitute a waiver by Sublessor of its right to enforce its other remedies hereunder, at law, or in equity. If any portion of said deposit is so used, applied, or retained, Sublessee shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of written demand from Sublessor, restore said deposit to its original amount. Sublessee’s failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of this Sublease, and in such event Sublessor may elect, among or in addition to other remedies, to terminate this Sublease. Sublessor shall not be a trustee of such deposit, and shall not be required to keep this deposit separate from its accounts. Sublessor alone shall be entitled to any interest or earnings thereon and Sublessor shall have the free use of same. If Sublessee fully and faithfully performs all of its obligations hereunder, then the deposit, less any amounts used by Sublessor as permitted by this section and not reimbursed by Sublessee, shall be returned to Sublessee (without payment of interest or earnings thereon) within 30 days after the later of (i) expiration or sooner termination of the term hereof, or (ii) Sublessee’s surrender of possession of the Subleased Premises to Sublessor.

 

4.2 Letter of Credit. Two (2) business days after Sublessee’s receipt of a copy of the Consent by Master Lessor to this Sublease, Sublessee shall provide to Sublessor an unconditional, clean, irrevocable Letter of Credit (“Letter of Credit”) in the amount of Thirty Seven Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($37,000) in favor of Sublessor and issued by a bank (which accepts deposits, maintains accounts and will negotiate a letter of credit, and whose deposits are insured by the FDIC) located in the Bay Area and reasonably acceptable to Sublessor (“Issuer”). The Letter of Credit shall (1) be fully transferable by Sublessor to a successor in its interest under this Sublease without payment of transfer fees, (2) permit multiple drawings, and (3) provide that draws, including partial draws, at Sublessor’s election, will be honored upon the delivery to the Issuer a certificate signed by Sublessor, or its authorized agent, that Sublessee is in default under this Sublease and that as a result thereof Sublessor is entitled to make the requested draw pursuant to the terms of the Sublease. The Letter of Credit is to be issued pursuant to ISP98 rather than UCP 500. If Sublessee fails to pay Rent or any other sums as and when due hereunder, or otherwise defaults with respect to any provision of this Sublease, Sublessor may (but shall not be obligated to) use, apply or retain all or any portion of the Letter of Credit for payment of any sum for which Sublessee is obligated or which will compensate Sublessor for any loss or damage which Sublessor may suffer thereby. Any draw or partial draw of the Letter of Credit shall not constitute a waiver by Sublessor of its right to enforce its other remedies hereunder, at law or in equity. If any portion of the Letter of Credit is drawn upon, Sublessee shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of written demand from Sublessor, restore said Letter of Credit to its original amount. The Letter of Credit shall be in effect for the entire term of this Sublease plus sixty (60) days beyond the expiration of the Sublease term. The Letter of Credit will automatically renew each year during the Sublease term unless the beneficiary under the Letter of Credit is given at least thirty (30) days prior notice of a non-renewal by the issuing bank, and Sublessor shall be able to draw on the Letter of Credit in the event of such notice. The parties agree that the provisions of Civil Code Sections 1950.7 and 1951.7 do not apply to the Letter of Credit.

CONDITION OF SUBLEASED PREMISES

 

5.1 Condition of the Subleased Premises. Sublessee acknowledges that as of the Commencement Date, the Subleased Premises, and every part thereof, are in good condition and without need of repair, and Sublessee accepts the Subleased Premises “as is”, Sublessee having made all investigations and tests it has deemed necessary or desirable in order to establish to its own complete satisfaction the condition of the Subleased Premises. Sublessee accepts the Subleased Premises in their condition existing as of the Commencement Date, subject to all applicable zoning, municipal, county and state laws, ordinances, and regulations governing and regulating the use of the Subleased Premises and any covenants or restrictions of record. Sublessee acknowledges that neither Sublessor nor Master Lessor have made any representations or warranties as to the condition of the Subleased Premises or its present or future suitability for Sublessee’s purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublessor shall deliver possession of the Subleased Premises to Sublessee professionally cleaned (which shall consist of vacuuming the carpet and cleaning the windows) and the operating systems in good working condition, including but not limited to HVAC, electrical, elevator, plumbing, and lighting.

 

5.2 Surrender. Sublessee shall keep the Subleased Premises, and every part thereof in at least the same condition it was received from Sublessor, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Sublessee shall surrender the Subleased Premises in the same condition as received, ordinary wear and tear excepted, provided Sublessee performs all necessary maintenance, repair and cleaning to maintain the Subleased Premises in the condition it was delivered at the Commencement Date.

 

ARTICLE 6

 

INSURANCE

 

6.1 Sublessee’s Insurance With respect to the Tenant’s insurance under the Master Lease, the same is to be provided by Sublessee as described in the Master Lease, and such policies of insurance shall include as additional insureds Master Lessor, Sublessor and any lender as required by Master Lessor.

 

6.2 Waiver of Subrogation. With respect to the waiver of subrogation contained in the Master Lease, such waiver shall be deemed to be modified to constitute an agreement by and among Master Lessor, Sublessor and Sublessee (and Master Lessor’s consent to this Sublease shall be deemed to constitute its approval of this modification).

 

-5-

ARTICLE 7

 

USE OF SUBLEASED PREMISES; PARKING; IMPROVEMENTS

 

7.1 Use of Subleased Premises Sublessee shall occupy and use the Subleased Premises only for general office use, research and development and other legal related uses. Sublessee shall not allow the Premises to be used in any manner that is inconsistent or prohibited under Section 6 of the Master Lease.

 

7.2 Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FF&E) Sublessee shall have use of all of the existing wired cubicle systems, desks, chairs, office furniture, conference room furniture, filing cabinets, book shelves, white boards, kitchen appliances, networking systems, and phone handsets and phone system that currently exist in the Subleased Premises throughout the entire term of the Sublease at no additional cost to Sublessee. Sublessor shall provide a list of furnishings, fixtures and equipment and attach it to this Sublease as Exhibit B. Sublessee accepts such FF&E “as is, where is” with no warranty, and at termination of this Sublease shall deliver same back to Sublessor in the same condition as received, ordinary wear and tear excepted; provided, however, that if Sublessee enters into a lease with Master Lessor for the Subleased Premises to continue immediately after the Expiration Date, and if Sublessee is not otherwise in breach of this Sublease, the FF&E shall become the property of Sublessee on the Expiration Date. Sublessee will insure the FF&E against casualty for its replacement value. Sublessor shall cooperate with Sublessee to permit Sublessee to be able to use such FF&E, by providing to Sublessee, to the extent same are available to Sublessor, all manuals, instructions and other documents and information necessary or convenient to the operation of such FF&E, including access codes, passwords and other keys to properly use such FF&E.

 

7.3 Parking. So long as Sublessee is not in default and subject to the rules and regulations imposed from time to time by Master Lessor or Sublessor, Sublessee shall have the right to use all of the parking spaces associated with the Premises as specified in the Master Lease.

 

ARTICLE 8

 

ASSIGNMENT, SUBLETTING & ENCUMBRANCE

 

8.1 Consent Required. Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease or any interest therein nor shall Sublessee sublet, license, encumber or permit the Subleased Premises or any part thereof to be used or occupied by others, without Sublessor’s and Master Lessor’s prior written consent. Sublessor’s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld provided, however, Sublessor’s withholding of consent shall in all events be deemed reasonable if for any reason Master Lessor’s consent is not obtained. The consent by Sublessor and Master Lessor to any assignment or subletting shall not waive the need for Sublessee (and Sublessee’s assignee or subtenant) to obtain the consent of Sublessor and Master Lessor to any different or further assignment or subletting. All Conditions and Standards set forth in the Master Lease regarding assignments and subletting shall apply, and to the extent there is any Bonus Rents (Rent paid by such Assignee or SubSublessee in excess of Rent paid by Sublessee hereunder), the Bonus Rent shall first be split per the Master Lease and any Bonus Rent to go to Sublessee shall be split 50/50 with Sublessor to be paid to Sublessor within five (5) days of receipt by Sublessee.

 

-6-

8.2 Form of Document. Every assignment, agreement, or sublease shall (i) recite that it is and shall be subject and subordinate to the provisions of this Sublease, that the assignee or subtenant assumes Sublessee’s obligation hereunder, that the termination of this Sublease shall at Sublessor’s sole election, constitute a termination of every such assignment or sublease, and (ii) contain such other terms and conditions as shall be reasonably requested or provided by Sublessor’s attorneys.

 

8.3 No Release of Sublessee. Regardless of Sublessor’s consent, no subletting or assignment shall release Sublessee of Sublessee’s obligation or alter the primary liability of Sublessee to pay the Rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Sublessee hereunder. The acceptance of Rent by Sublessor from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Sublessor of any provision hereof. In the event of default by any assignee, subtenant or any other successor of Sublessee, in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Sublessor may proceed directly against Sublessee without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such assignee, subtenant or successor.

 

8.4 Default. An involuntary assignment shall constitute a default and Sublessor shall have the right to elect to terminate this Sublease, in which case this Sublease shall not be treated as an asset of Sublessee.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

DEFAULT

 

9.1 Default Described. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a material breach of this Sublease and a default by Sublessee: (i) failure to pay Rent or any other amount within three (3) business days after due; (ii) all those items of default set forth in the Master Lease which remain uncured after the cure period provided in the Master Lease; or (iii) Sublessee’s failure to perform timely and subject to any cure periods any other material provision of this Sublease or the Master Lease as incorporated herein.

 

9.2 Sublessor’s Remedies. Sublessor shall have the remedies set forth in the Master Lease as if Sublessor is Master Lessor. These remedies are not exclusive; they are cumulative and in addition to any remedies now or later allowed by law.

 

9.3 Sublessee’s Right to Possession Not Terminated. Sublessor has the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (lessor may continue lease in effect after lessee’s breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due, if lessee has right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations). Sublessor may continue this Sublease in full force and effect, and Sublessor shall have the right to collect rent and other sums when due. During the period Sublessee is in default, Sublessor may enter the Subleased Premises and relet them, or any part of them, to third parties for Sublessee’s account and alter or install locks and other security devices at the Subleased Premises. Sublessee shall be liable immediately to Sublessor for all costs Sublessor incurs and as permitted by law in reletting the Subleased

 

-7-

Premises, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, brokers’ commissions, expenses of remodeling the Subleased Premises required by the reletting, and like costs. Reletting may be for a period equal to, shorter or longer than the remaining term of this Sublease and rent received by Sublessor shall be applied to (i) first, any indebtedness from Sublessee to Sublessor other than rent due from Sublessee; (ii) second, all costs incurred by Sublessor in reletting, including, without limitation, brokers’ fees or commissions and attorneys fees, the cost of removing and storing the property of Sublessee or any other occupant, and the costs of repairing, altering, maintaining, remodeling or otherwise putting the Subleased Premises into condition acceptable to a new Sublessee or Sublessees; (iii) third, rent due and unpaid under this Sublease. After deducting the payments referred to in this subsection 9.3, any sum remaining from the rent Sublessor receives from reletting shall be held by Sublessor and applied in payment of future rent and other amounts as rent and such amounts become due under this Sublease. In no event shall Sublessee be entitled to any excess rent received by Sublessor.

 

9.4 All Sums Due and Payable as Rent. Sublessee shall also pay without notice, or where notice is required under this Sublease, immediately upon demand without any abatement, deduction, or setoff, as additional rent all sums, impositions, costs, expenses, and other payments which Sublessee in any of the provisions of this Sublease assumes or agrees to pay, and, in case of any nonpayment thereof, Sublessor shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies, all the rights and remedies provided for in this Sublease or by law in the case of nonpayment of rent.

 

9.5 No Waiver. Sublessor may accept Sublessee’s payments of less than full amount of rent due without waiving any rights under the Sublease, including rights under a previously served notice of default. So long as there is a default hereunder, no payment by Sublessee or receipt by Sublessor of a lesser amount than any installment of rent due or other sums shall be deemed as other than a payment on account of the amount due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction; and Sublessor may accept such check or payment without prejudice of Sublessor’s right to recover the balance of such rent or other sum or pursue any other remedy provided in this Sublease, at law or in equity. If Sublessor accepts payments after serving a notice of default, Sublessor may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Sublessee any further notice or demand. Furthermore, the Sublessor’s acceptance of rent from Sublessee when the Sublessee is holding over without express written consent does not convert Sublessee’s tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month-to-month tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Sublease shall be implied by any failure of Sublessor to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision, even if that violation continues or is repeated. Any waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease must be in writing. Such waiver shall affect only the provisions specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Sublessor shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof by Sublessor. No act or conduct of Sublessor, including, without limitation the acceptance of keys to the Subleased Premises shall constitute acceptance or the surrender of the Subleased Premises by Sublessee before the Expiration Date. Only written notice from Sublessor to Sublessee of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance or surrender of the Subleased Premises. Sublessor’s consent to or approval of any act by Sublessee which requires Sublessor’s consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary Sublessor’s consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Sublessee.

 

-8-

9.6 Sublessor Default. For purposes of this Sublease, Sublessor shall not be deemed in default hereunder unless and until Sublessee shall first deliver to Sublessor written notice of such default, and Sublessor shall fail to promptly cure said default or to commence to cure said default and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion

 

9.7 Notice of Event of Default under Master Lease. Sublessor shall notify Sublessee of any Event of Default under the Master Lease, or of any other event of which Sublessor has actual knowledge which will impair Sublessee’s ability to conduct its normal business at the Subleased Premises, as soon as reasonably practicable following Sublessor’s receipt of notice from Master Lessor of an Event of Default or Sublessor’s actual knowledge of such impairment.

LANDLORD’S CONSENT TO SUBLEASE

(Blue Coat Systems/ Infoblox Inc.)

 

SUNNYVALE VIII TRUST, a Maryland business trust (“Landlord”), landlord under that certain Lease Agreement dated March 30, 2001 (the “Master Lease”), by and between Landlord and, CACHEFLOW INC., a Delaware corporation now known as BLUE COAT SYSTEMS (“Tenant”) hereby consents to the subleasing of a portion of the Premises (as defined in the Master Lease) by Tenant, as sublessor, to INFOBLOX INC., a Delaware corporation (“Subtenant”) as subtenant, specifically under the terms and with respect to such subleased premises (the “Sublease Premises”) as described in the Sublease Agreement dated as of October     , 2004 attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Sublease”) by and between Tenant and Subtenant, subject to the following:

 

1. Occupancy of the Sublease Premises by Subtenant is in all respects subject to the Master Lease, and Landlord hereby informs Tenant and Subtenant that Landlord requires strict compliance by Tenant and Subtenant with all the terms and conditions of the Master Lease. Neither the Sublease nor this consent shall release or discharge Tenant from any liability under the Master Lease and Tenant shall remain liable and responsible for the full performance and observance of all of the provisions, covenants, and conditions set forth in the Master Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed and observed. The breach or violation of any provision of the Master Lease by Subtenant shall constitute a default by Tenant in fulfilling such provision and any breach of the Master Lease by either Tenant or Subtenant shall entitled Landlord to all the rights and remedies provided in the Master Lease in the event of a breach, and any other available remedy, against both Tenant and Subtenant.

 

2. This consent shall not be construed as approval or consent to any provision(s) of the Sublease which may conflict with or be interpreted to restrict Landlord’s rights or Tenant’s obligations under the Master Lease, or to expand upon Tenant’s rights or Landlord’s obligations under the Master Lease, and Landlord shall not be bound or estopped in any way by the provisions of the Sublease, including any provision which purports to bind Landlord in any way contrary to the terms of the Master Lease; provided, that as set forth in Section 6.2 Waiver of Subrogation, the waiver of subrogation set forth in the Master Lease shall apply among Landlord, Tenant and Subtenant.

Exhibit 10.4

 

LANDLORD’S CONSENT TO SUBLEASE

 

This Agreement is made as of September 22, 2005, among (“Landlord”), Teutsch Partners, Conoco Phillips Company, a Delaware corporation (“Tenant”), and Zymogenetics, (“Subtenant”).

 

RECITALS:

 

A. Pursuant to a Lease dated as of September 19, 2003 (the “Lease”), between Landlord and Tenant, Tenant is leasing from Landlord certain premises (the “Premises”) situated on the 2nd floor of the building (the “Building”) currently known as the 1144 Eastlake Building, located at 1144 Eastlake Ave. East, Seattle WA.

 

B. Pursuant to a Sublease in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A (the “Sublease”), Tenant has agreed to sublease to Subtenant a portion of the Premises, as more particularly described in the Sublease.

 

C. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Tenant must obtain the prior written consent of Landlord to any sublease of all or any portion of the Premises. Landlord is prepared to consent to the Sublease on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT:

 

Landlord hereby consents to the Sublease, subject to the following terms, covenants and agreements of the parties, and in consideration of such consent, Tenant and Subtenant agrees as follows:

 

1. Neither the Sublease nor this Agreement shall be construed to relieve Tenant of any liabilities or obligations whatsoever under the lease. Tenant shall continue to be fully and primarily liable for the full performance of all obligations of the tenant under the Lease.

 

2. Subtenant and Tenant acknowledge and agree the Sublease and all of Subtenant’s rights thereunder shall be subject and subordinated in all respects to the Lease. If the Lease terminates or is terminated prior to the expiration of the term of the Sublease, the Sublease also shall terminate; provided, however, at Landlord’s sole option, following a termination of the Lease, the Sublease shall remain in full force and effect, in which event Subtenant shall attorn to Landlord and recognize Landlord as Subtenant’s landlord under the Sublease, upon the terms and conditions and at the rental rate specified in the Sublease, and for the then remaining term of the Sublease, except Landlord shall not be bound by any provision of the Sublease which in any way increases Landlord’s duties, obligations or liabilities to Subtenant beyond those owed to tenant under the Lease. Subtenant shall execute and deliver at any time and from time to time upon the request of landlord, any instruments which may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such attornment. Landlord shall not in any event (i) be liable to Subtenant for any act, omission or breach of the Sublease by Tenant, (ii) be subject to any offsets or defenses which Subtenant might have against Tenant, (iii) be bound by any rent or additional rent which Subtenant might have paid in advance to Tenant, or (iv) be bound to honor any rights of Subtenant in and to any

security or other deposits paid by Subtenant pursuant to the Lease except to the extent Tenant has turned over such security or other deposits to Landlord. If Tenant is in default under the terms of the Lease, Landlord shall have the right to take all actions available to Landlord under the Lease and by law, including but not limited to the right to commence an unlawful detainer action against Tenant and Subtenant.

 

3. Whenever the Lease gives Landlord a right of involvement, such as a right to approve, consent, cooperate or decide, Landlord shall have such right with respect to both Tenant and Subtenant. If Landlord and Tenant disagree over any decision requiring both of their consents or approvals, Landlord’s decision shall control. For example, the Lease requires Landlord’s prior consent to any alterations or additions to the Premises. If Subtenant desires to make alterations or additions to the Premises, it must obtain the prior consent of both Landlord and Tenant.

 

4. Tenant will pay Landlord’s attorneys’ fees in reviewing the Sublease and preparing this Agreement, not to exceed $1,500.00.

 

5. The indemnity and other agreements contained in the Sublease (or incorporated therein by reference) shall apply with equal force and effect between Subtenant and Landlord (with Subtenant indemnifying Landlord in accordance with the terms of the Sublease), and Landlord shall be named as an additional insured on any insurance maintained by Subtenant under the Sublease.

 

6. This Agreement shall not relieve Tenant of its obligation to obtain Landlord’s consent to (a) any further sublease of all or part of the Premises, or (b) any assignment of the Lease; nor shall the Sublease or this Agreement be construed as conferring upon Subtenant any right to further sublease the Premises or assign its rights under the Sublease in either case without Landlord’s consent.

 

7. A failure by Tenant or Subtenant to comply with any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall constitute a default under the Lease. If any party to this Agreement commences an action or other legal proceeding to enforce performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof or of the Lease, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall, in addition to such other relief as it may obtain, be entitled to recover from the other parties all of its costs incurred, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in any such action or proceeding or any appeal from any order, award or judgment therein.

 

8. In addition to Landlord’s rights under this Agreement, the Lease, at law or in equity, if Tenant is in default under any of the terms or provisions of the Lease, Landlord may elect to receive directly from Subtenant all sums due or payable to Tenant by Subtenant pursuant to the Sublease, and upon receipt of written notice from Landlord to do so, Subtenant shall thereafter pay Landlord any sums becoming due or payable under the Sublease. Tenant hereby consents to such direct payment and authorizes and directs Subtenant to comply with any notice given by Landlord to Subtenant pursuant to the proceeding sentence. Neither the service of such written notice nor the receipt and acceptance of such direct payments shall cause Landlord to be deemed to have assumed any of Tenant’s duties, obligations and/or liabilities to Subtenant under the Sublease, nor shall such event impose upon the Landlord the duty or obligation to accept an attornment by Subtenant following a termination of the Lease.

9. Any options to extend the Lease, rights of first refusal to lease additional space or right to expand the Premises may not be exercised by or for the benefit of Subtenant.

 

10. Subtenant and Tenant shall not amend or modify the Sublease without Landlord’s prior written consent.

 

11.

SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS AGREEMENT (hereinafter referred to as the “Sublease”) is made and entered into as of the          day of September 2005, between ConocoPhillips Company, a Delaware corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “Sublessor”) and ZymoGenetics, Inc., a Washington corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “Sublessee”).

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Sublessor desires to sublease its interest in a portion of the “Premises”, as defined in the Prime Lease (as such term is hereinafter defined), to Sublessee; and

 

WHEREAS, Sublessee desires to sublease the Sublease Premises from Sublessor upon the terms and conditions contained herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged by said parties, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

 

1. Sublease Premises. Sublessor hereby leases to Sublessee and Sublessee hereby leases from Sublessor approximately 7,128 rentable square feet of space on the 2nd floor (currently identified as Suite 201) of 1144 Eastlake Building (the “Building”) which is located at 1144 Eastlake Avenue E, Seattle, Washington 98109, as shown on the floor plan, less the area shown hatched in black, attached hereto as Exhibit “A” and made a part hereof (the “Sublease Premises”) for a term of 37 months, commencing on the later of October 1, 2005 or the date Sublessor delivers the Sublease Premises to Sublessee (the “Commencement Date”)-and ending at 11:59 p.m. on October 31, 2008, regardless of the actual Commencement Date, (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Sublease Term”), unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, and subject to the contingencies specified in Article 14 hereof. Sublessee agrees that the Sublease Commencement Date shall be the later of October 1, 2005, or the date of actual delivery of the Sublease Premises to Sublessee. Sublessor and Sublessee further agree that if the Commencement Date is later than October 1, 2005, Sublessee’s payment of Monthly Rental and Additional Rent in the amounts applicable for the specific period of time on the actual Commencement Date as reflected in the rent schedule shown below in Article 2(a) and Article 2(c) shall be payable on or before the actual date of commencement. Upon the request of either party or Prime Lessor, Sublessor and Sublessee shall execute a Commencement Date Certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit “C.”

 

(b) Late or Early Delivery. In the event Sublessor is unable to deliver possession of the Premises at the commencement of the term, Sublessor shall not be liable for any damage caused thereby, nor shall this Sublease be void or voidable but Sublessee shall not be liable for rent until such time as Sublessor offers to deliver possession of the Premises to Sublessee, but the term hereof shall not be extended by such delay. If Sublessee, with Sublessor’s and Prime Lessor’s consents, takes possession prior to the commencement of the term, Sublessee shall do so subject to all the covenants and conditions hereof except for the payment of Monthly Rent and Additional Rent which shall be free from such prior date to the commencement of the term until October 1, 2005 which Monthly Rent and Additional Rent thereafter shall be as reflected in the rent schedule shown below in Article 2.

 

2. Rent; Security Deposit; Parking.

 

(a) Sublessee agrees to pay to Sublessor at the address Sublessor designates herein, or at such other place as Sublessor may designate in writing, without demand, counterclaim, deduction or setoff, in legal tender, base rental for the Sublease Term payable in monthly base rental installments (“Monthly Rental”) as follows:

 

Date/Term

  	Monthly Installment
of Base Rent
  	Yearly Rental Rate
Per Rentable Square Foot
10-01-05 to 11-30-05

  	$	0.00	  	$	0.00
12-01-05 to 10-31-06

  	$	13,929.30	  	$	23.45
11-01-06 to 10-31-07

  	$	14,523.30	  	$	24.45
11-01-07 to 10-31-08

  	$	15,117.30	  	$	25.45
Sublessee shall pay the Monthly Rental and any other sum due hereunder as rent, whether or not designated as rent, to ConocoPhillips Company, ATTN: Tax ID 91-1144498, 21064 Network Place, Chicago, IL 60673-1210. The reference “Tax ID 91-1144498” shall to be inserted on all rental checks. Sublessee shall pay the Monthly Rental in advance not later than the 1st day of every month during the Sublease Term. Notwithstanding the above, concurrently with its execution hereof, Sublessee has paid to Sublessor the first month’s rent due under this Sublease.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sublessee receives a notice from the Prime Lessor that the Sublessor has defaulted on its monetary obligations under the Prime Lease, then from and after that date Sublessee receives such notice, regardless of any subsequent cure of such default, Sublessee shall have the right but not the obligation to deliver all subsequent Monthly Rental and Additional Rent accruing hereunder directly to the Prime Lessor for Sublessor’s account (or to continue to pay Sublessor directly).

 

(b) The Base Year for the Sublease shall be 2005.

 

(c) Sublessee shall pay monthly as “Additional Rent” the Sublessee’s Pro Rata Share of Expenses, Taxes and Insurance, as defined in Article 4.2 of the Prime Lease that exceeds the Base Year Operating Costs as defined therein. The Sublessee’s Pro Rata Share is estimated in Article 1.4 of the Prime Lease as 8.92% or as modified by the Prime Lessor. Any cap (currently at 5%) on such expenses stated in the Prime Lease’s paragraph 4.2 shall apply to this Sublease as well.

 

(d) Sublessor and Sublessee agree that there shall be no initial security deposit required. Sublessor reserves the right to demand, and Sublessee agrees to pay, a deposit of $20,000 should Sublessee default per the terms of Article 10 below, if such default is not cured within the applicable notice and cure period. Upon notice to Sublessee by Sublessor, the following language shall be added language to the Sublease:

 

“Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor $20,000.00 as security for Sublessee’s payment of Monthly Rental and performance of its other obligations under this Sublease and any renewals or extensions of this Sublease. If Sublessee defaults in its payment of Monthly Rental or performance of its other obligations under this Sublease, Sublessor may use all or part of the security deposit for the payment of Monthly Rental or any other amount in default, or for the payment of any other amount that Sublessor may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of Sublessee’s default, or for the payment to Sublessor of any other loss or damage that Sublessor may suffer by reason of Sublessee’s default. If Sublessor so uses any portion of the security deposit, Sublessee will restore the security deposit to its original amount within five (5) days after written demand from Sublessor. Sublessor will not be required to keep the security deposit separate for its own funds and Sublessee will not be entitled to interest on the security deposit. The security deposit will not be a limitation on Sublessor’s damages or other rights under this Sublease, or a payment of liquidated damages, or an advance payment of the Monthly Rental. Upon expiration of the Sublease Term or earlier termination of this Sublease the security deposit shall be returned to Sublessee within a reasonable amount of time after such termination, reduced by such amounts as may be required by Sublessor to remedy defaults on the part of Sublessee in the payment of Monthly Rental, to repair damage to the Sublease Premises and the Building caused by Sublessee, its agents, employees, invitees and licensees and to clean the Sublease Premises.”

 

(e) At no additional charge to Sublessee, Sublessee shall be entitled to the use, on a non-exclusive basis, fourteen (14) parking stalls in the Building and the non-exclusive use of three (3) additional parking stalls located either in the Building or in surface parking lots in the vicinity of the Building. Use of such parking stalls shall be upon such terms and conditions and subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as

Prime Lessor or Sublessor may publish from time to time and otherwise strictly in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Article 30 of the Prime Lease (but without any requirement that Sublessee pay the amounts stated therein for such stalls) as such amounts are included in the Monthly Rental as stated in Article 2 above.

 

3. Subordinate to Prime Lease, Sublessor Covenants.

 

(a) That certain so-called Office Lease entered into as of the 19th day of September, 2003 by and between Sublessor, as tenant therein, and 1144 Eastlake LLC, as landlord therein (“Prime Lessor”), pursuant to which Sublessor leases and occupies approximately 7,128 rentable square feet of space on the 2nd floor of the Building (the “Premises”), is herein referred to as the “Prime Lease”. The Sublease Premises is comprised of the entire Premises. A copy of the Prime Lease, including all amendments and exhibits thereto is attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and made a part hereof. Sublessee acknowledges that it is familiar with the terms of the Prime Lease. In the event of any termination of the Prime Lease, this Sublease shall automatically terminate and Sublessor shall have no further liability to Sublessee. Except as may be inconsistent with the terms hereof, and subject to Sublessor performing its covenants stated in Article 3(b) below, all the terms, covenants, restrictions and conditions in the Prime Lease contained as of the date of this Sublease, shall be applicable to this Sublease with the same force and effect as if the Sublessor were the “lessor” under the Prime Lease (except with respect to Prime Lessor’s obligations to provide services under the Prime Lease, as to which Section 6 hereof shall prevail) and Sublessee were the “lessee” thereunder; and in the case of any breach hereof by Sublessee, Sublessor shall have all the rights against Sublessee as would be available to Prime Lessor against Sublessor as “lessee” under the Prime Lease. This Sublease is in all respects subject to and subordinate to the terms and conditions of the Prime Lease. Except as expressly contradicted by the terms of this Sublease, Sublessee agrees to be bound by all of the covenants, restrictions, terms and conditions of the Prime Lease in its use and occupancy of the Sublease Premises, and Sublessee covenants and agrees to perform all obligations of Sublessor arising under the Prime Lease during the term of this Sublease, and to refrain from violating or breaching any of the terms, covenants, restrictions and conditions of the Prime Lease.

 

(b) Sublessor hereby covenants and agrees for the Sublessee’s benefit as follows:

 

(i) To timely pay all Base Rent, Additional Rent and any other amounts due to Prime Lessor or otherwise under the Prime Lease;

 

(ii) Sublessor hereby waives irrevocably its Extension Rights under the Prime Lease at Article 1.5(c), covenants not to exercise such rights and agrees that the Prime Lessor may rely upon its statement in this subsection as a complete waiver;

 

(iii) Not to voluntarily cause, permit or consent to the termination or alternation of the Prime Lease, without first obtaining Sublessee’s consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(iv) Sublessee shall and may peacefully have, hold and enjoy the Sublease Premises free from any person claiming a right thereto through Sublessor, subject to the terms of this Sublease and the Prime Lease, provided Sublessee pays the Monthly Rental and Additional Rent and fully performs all of its covenants and agreements;

 

(v) To deliver, as soon as practicable via facsimile, copies of all notices it receives from the Prime Lessor relating to the Sublease Premises, this Sublease or otherwise under the Prime Lease; and

 

(vi) Upon request by Sublessee, if reasonably determined necessary by Sublessee to establish privity of contract or other standing to compel Prime Lessor to perform, Sublessor will agree join as a co-plaintiff or co-petitioner with Sublessee in any action against Prime Lessor concerning a breach of Prime Lessor’s obligations under the Prime Lease; provided, however, that as a condition concurrent with Sublessor’s agreement to join in such action, Sublessee agrees (A) to reimburse Sublessor

immediately upon demand as Additional Rent, all of Sublessor’s expenses, including attorney’s fees, in connection with such action; (B) that by virtue of making a request for joinder, Sublessee has agreed to indemnify, defend and hold Sublessor harmless, for any of Sublessor’s claims, losses, costs, expenses and/or damages arising from or relating to Sublessee’s actions under this Subsection 3(b)(vi), including, but not limited to attorney’s fees and costs.

 

4. Insurance. Sublessee shall maintain at all times during the term of this Sublease, at its sole expense, comprehensive general liability insurance against claims for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage occurring on, in or about the Sublease Premises in the amount of $10,000,000 per occurrence and shall name Sublessor and Prime Lessor as additional insureds. Sublessee shall also maintain, at its sole expense, physical damage insurance, on all of its personal property, including removable trade fixtures, located in the Sublease Premises and on all additions and leasehold improvements in the Sublease Premises. Such insurance shall be written on an “all risks” of physical loss or damage basis, for the full replacement cost value new without deduction for depreciation of the covered items and in amounts that meet any coinsurance clauses of the policies of insurance and shall include a vandalism and malicious mischief endorsement, sprinkler leakage coverage and earthquake sprinkler leakage coverage. All such insurance policies shall comply with all requirements of the Prime Lease, and shall be maintained with an insurance company licensed in the State of Washington with a Best’s rating of “A-VIII” or better in Best’s Insurance Guide. Sublessee shall deliver the certificate(s) of all such insurance prior to the commencement date of this Sublease and upon request, at any time thereafter. The insurance certificates shall provide that such insurance shall not be cancelled or materially adversely amended without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Sublessor and Prime Lessor. Sublessee agrees to have any and all physical damage coverage and all material damage insurance that will either include in the policy a right of Sublessee to waive subrogation without affecting the insureds’ rights to recover under the policy, or endorsed with the following subrogation clause: “This insurance shall not be invalidated should the insurer waive in writing prior to a loss any or all right of recovery against any party for loss occurring to the property described herein.” Sublessee hereby expressly waives all rights of recovery which it might otherwise have against Sublessor or Prime Lessor, for any loss or damage to personal property to the extent that such loss is covered, or would be covered by the insurance, required by this Article 4, if it were in effect. Sublessee shall further cause its insurers to waive any right of subrogation that they might otherwise have against Sublessor or Prime Lessor. Should premiums paid by the Sublessor or Prime Lessor increase due to Sublessee’s operations, the contents within the Sublease Premises or improvements made to the Sublease Premises, Sublessee shall promptly pay the increased amount of the premium upon request to Sublessor or Prime Lessor, respectively.

 

5. “As Is” Condition; Use; Alterations. Sublessee shall assume all of Sublessor’s obligations in Article 8 of the Prime Lease and shall take the Sublease Premises on an “as is” basis, subject to Sublessor delivering the Sublease Premises with the equipment listed on attached Exhibit “DD” (the “Sublease Premises FF&E”). As used herein “as is” means the condition the Sublease Premises and the Sublease Premises FF&E are in as of the execution date of this Sublease, subject to ordinary wear and tear. Sublessee’s taking possession of any portion of the Sublease Premises with such Sublease Premises FF&E shall be conclusive evidence against Sublessee that such portion of the Sublease Premises was in a good order and satisfactory condition when Sublessee took possession. No promise of Sublessor to alter, remodel, repair or improve the Sublease Premises and no representation respecting the condition of the Sublease Premises or the Building or any portion thereof have been made by Sublessor to Sublessee except as otherwise provided above in this Article 5. SUBLESSOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, AND SUBLESSEE HEREBY WAIVES, ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR TYPE WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBLEASED PREMISES, THE SUBLEASE PREMISES FF&E, THE BUILDING, OR ANY IMPROVEMENTS LOCATED THEREON, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BY WAY OF DESCRIPTION BUT NOT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITION OR SAFETY. SUBLESSEE EXPRESSLY

AGREES THAT NEITHER SUBLESSOR, NOR ANYONE ACTING FOR OR ON BEHALF OF THE SUBLESSOR, HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR PROMISE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO SUBLESSEE CONCERNING THE QUALITY, VALUE, PHYSICAL ASPECTS OR CONDITIONS OF THE SUBLEASED PREMISES, THE SUBLEASE PREMISES FF&E, THE BUILDING OR ANY IMPROVEMENTS LOCATED THEREON, OR ANY OTHER MATTER WITH RESPECT THERETO, AND THAT SUBLESSEE HAS NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR PROMISE. SUBLESSEE AGREES THAT IT HAS MADE A PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE SUBLEASED PREMISES, THE SUBLEASE PREMISES FF&E, THE BUILDING, AND ANY BUILDINGS AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS LOCATED THEREON AND IS IN ALL RESPECTS SATISFIED WITH THE CONDITION AND FITNESS THEREOF AND ACCEPTS THE SAME “AS IS”, “WHERE IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS, IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT DISCLAIMERS OF THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION ARE “CONSPICUOUS” DISCLAIMERS FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW, RULE OR ORDER. SUBLESSOR DOES NOT WARRANT EITHER EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY THE CONDITION OR FITNESS OF THE PROPERTY SUBLEASED HEREUNDER, ANY SUCH WARRANTY BEING HEREBY EXPRESSLY NEGATIVED. The Sublease Premises shall be used and occupied by Sublessee solely for the purpose of general office uses and for no other purpose. Sublessee covenants and agrees that it will, at its expense, comply with all laws, ordinances, orders, directions, requirements, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities (including federal, state, county and municipal authorities), now in force or which may hereafter be in force, which shall impose any duty upon Prime Lessor, Sublessor or Sublessee with respect to the use, occupancy or alteration of the Sublease Premises and of all insurance bodies applicable to the Sublease Premises and to the Sublessee’s use or occupancy thereof. Sublessee shall not use or permit the use of the Sublease Premises in any manner that will tend to create waste or a nuisance or to disturb other tenants of the Building or that will violate any of the terms or provisions of the Prime Lease.

 

Any alterations, additions or improvements desired by Sublessee shall be at Sublessee’s sole cost and expense and must be first approved in writing by Sublessor and Prime Lessor, with the requirements for approvals, the standards and timetables therefore as set forth and pursuant to the provisions stated in the Prime Lease at Article 9.3 therein, but including both Sublessor and Prime Lessor as approving parties, when applicable. Any such additions, alterations or modifications shall be carried out by Sublessee, at its own expense, in accordance with the provisions of the Prime Lease. Sublessee shall indemnify and hold harmless Sublessor and Prime Lessor from any and all costs, expenses, claims or liabilities, incurred in connection with the installation by Sublessee of any additions, alterations or modifications to or of the Sublease Premises, except to the extent done at the direction of the Sublessor or Prime Lessor.

 

6. Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the only services or rights to which Sublessee is entitled hereunder are those to which Sublessor is entitled to as “lessee” under the Prime Lease and that for all such services and rights Sublessee will look to Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease. Except as expressly setforth in Article 3(b) above, nothing contained in this Sublease shall in any way obligate Sublessor to perform any act required to be performed by the Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease, nor shall Sublessor incur any liability of Sublessee by virtue of the Prime Lessor’s failure to perform any act required of it or Prime Lessor’s failure to give any consent under the Prime Lease. Sublessor agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause Prime Lessor to provide the services required of Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease.

 

7. No Acts. Sublessee shall neither do nor permit anything to be done which would cause the Prime Lease to be terminated or forfeited or any claims to accrue to the benefit of Prime Lessor by reasons of any right of termination or forfeiture reserved or vested in Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease, or any rights to damages accruing to or for the benefit of Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease, and Sublessee shall indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from and against all loss, cost, damage or expense, including,

but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and court costs, incurred by Sublessor by reason of any default on the part of Sublessee by reason of which the Prime Lease may be terminated or forfeited, or any claim shall accrue to the benefit of or for Sublessor under the Prime Lease. Sublessee agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold Sublessor harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments, decrees, orders, liabilities, or expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements arising out of or on account of any damage or injuries, including wrongful death sustained or claimed to have been sustained to any person or property in or upon the Sublease Premises by any person whatsoever unless the same shall result directly and exclusively from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of Sublessor. Sublessor shall not be liable for damage to person or property sustained by Sublessee or any other person, however such damage may have been caused, except to the extent resulting from the Sublessor’s gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

 

8. Surrender. Upon the termination or expiration of this Sublease at any time and for any reason, Sublessee will immediately quit and peacefully surrender possession of the Sublease Premises and Sublessee agrees to return the Sublease Premises in the same condition as they existed at the date of Sublessee’s occupancy, except for ordinary wear and tear and except for alterations and improvements approved by Sublessor and Prime Lessor, and Sublessee shall remove all of its personal property therefrom. If Sublessee remains in possession of the Sublease Premises after the end of the term of this Sublease with the prior consent of Sublessor, and the Prime Lease is still in effect, then Sublessee will occupy the Sublease Premises as a tenant from month to month, subject to all conditions, provisions and obligations of this Sublease in effect on the last day of the term. If Sublessee remains in possession of the Sublease Premises after the end of the term of this Sublease without the consent of Sublessor, and the Prime Lease is still in effect, then Sublessee shall indemnify Sublessor against all claims, losses, costs, expenses, and damages arising therefrom.

 

9. No Assignment. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease or any interest hereunder or further sublet all or any part of the Sublease Premises, or permit the use of the Sublease Premises by any party other than Sublessee and the employees of Sublessee, without the prior written consent of Sublessor and Prime Lessor in each instance, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of Article 12 of the Prime Lease. Sublessee shall not permit Sublessee’s interest in this Sublease to be vested in any third party by operation of law or otherwise. In the event such consent is obtained, any rents or other consideration received under any such proposed sublease which exceed the rent as defined in this Sublease or any consideration for an assignment shall be paid to Sublessor as and when received by Sublessee. For purposes of this Article 9, an assignment of this Sublease shall be deemed to occur upon any change in the ownership of Sublessee as described in Article 12 of the Prime Lease, provided however that Sublessee shall be permitted to transfer this Sublease or its interest in the Sublease Premises without obtaining Sublessor or Prime Lessor’s consent for those transfers described in the Prime Lease’s Article 12.4.

 

10. Default. The following events shall be deemed to be events of default by Sublessee under this Sublease:

 

(a) Sublessee shall fail to pay any installment of rent hereby reserved as and when the same shall become due if the failure continues for three (3) business days after written notice to Sublessee (“Monetary Default). Sublessor may, at its sole option, invoke the provisions of Article 2(d) above regardless or whether or not a Monetary Default is cured;

 

(b) Sublessee shall fail (other than a Monetary Default) to comply with any term, provision or covenant of the Prime Lease or this Sublease and shall not cure such failure within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Sublessee. However, if Sublessee’s failure to comply cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days, Sublessee shall be allowed additional time as is reasonably necessary to cure the failure so long as: (1) Sublessee commences to cure the failure within thirty (30) days, and (2) Sublessee diligently pursues a course of action that will cure the failure and bring

Sublessee back into compliance with the Prime Lease and the Sublease. However, if Sublessee’s failure to comply creates a hazardous condition, the failure must be cured immediately upon notice to Sublessee;

 

(c) Sublessee shall become insolvent, or shall make a transfer in order to defraud creditors or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or admits in writing its inability to pay its debts when due;

 

(d) Sublessee shall file a petition under any section or chapter of the National Bankruptcy Act, as amended, or under any similar law or statute of the United States or any state thereof; or Sublessee shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent in proceedings filed against Sublessee thereunder;

 

(e) A receiver or trustee shall be appointed for all or substantially all of the assets of Sublessee not removed or dismissed within sixty (60) days;

 

(f) Sublessee shall otherwise cause Sublessor to be in default under the Prime Lease.

 

(g) Sublessee shall abandon the entire Sublease Premises.

 

Upon the occurrence of any such events of default, which is not cured within the applicable notice and cure periods stated above, Sublessor shall have all the Landlord rights set forth in Article 20 of the Prime Lease and Sublessee shall be deemed “Tenant” for all purposes therein and herein.

 

10A. Sublessor Default.

 

(a) If Sublessor breaches any covenant or agreement of this Sublease, then and in such event Sublessee shall have the remedies set forth in Article 21 of the Prime Lease as if Sublessee was the Tenant and Sublessor was the Landlord as those terms are used therein. The limitation of liability for Landlord contained in Article 21 of the Prime Lease shall not apply to this Sublease.

 

(b) To its knowledge, Sublessor represents and warrants to Sublessee that (i) neither Sublessor or Landlord is in breach of or in default under the Prime Lease and no event has occurred that, with notice and/or lapse of time, would constitute a breach or default by Sublessor or Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease, and (ii) a true, correct, and complete copy of the Prime Lease as in effect on the Effective Date is attached hereto as Exhibit “B”.

 

11. Force Majeure. Sublessor and Sublessee shall not be liable for delay caused by strikes, riots, acts of God, national emergencies, acts of public enemy, civil insurrection, difficulty in obtaining materials or any other causes beyond Sublessor’s or Sublessee’s control (except insufficiency of funds) in performing any of the covenants required hereunder to be performed by Sublessor and Sublessee, except the payment of rent and other sums to be paid by Sublessee hereunder.

 

12. Default Rate. Sublessor and Sublessee further agree that in the event Sublessee at any time during the Sublease Term is in default in the payment of rent, Sublessor shall have the right to charge interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is lower (the “Default Rate”), commencing on the sixth (6th) day after rent is due and continuing until rental payments are current. Sublessee hereby agrees to pay said interest upon notification by Sublessor.

 

13. Indemnity. Sublessee agrees that, to the extent not expressly prohibited by law, Sublessor and Prime Lessor, and their respective officers, agent and employees, shall not be liable for nor shall rent abate as a result of, any direct or consequential damage (including damage claimed for actual or constructive eviction) either to person or property, sustained by Sublessee or by other persons, due to the Building or any part thereof or any appurtenances thereof becoming out of repair, or due to any act or neglect of any tenant or occupant of the Building, or any other person. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Sublessee shall protect, indemnify and hold Sublessor and

Prime Lessor and their respective officers, agents, servants and employees harmless from and against any and all loss, costs, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys’ fees) of whatever nature arising from (i) injury to persons or damage to property on the Sublease Premises or in or about the Building arising out of or in connection with Sublessee’s use or occupancy of the Sublease Premises or Sublessee’s activities in the Building, or arising from any act or negligence of Sublessee, or its agents, contractors, servants, employees or invitees, or (ii) failure of Sublessee to perform its obligations under this Sublease, including those provisions of the Prime Lease incorporated herein by reference.

 

14. Consent of Prime Lessor. This Sublease and the obligations of both parties hereunder, are conditioned upon the written consent of Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease. This Sublease and any modifications or amendments thereof shall not take effect and be binding upon Sublessor until Sublessor obtains the written consent of Prime Lessor. Sublessor shall not be liable to Sublessee for any delay in delivering the Sublease Premises to Sublessee beyond the commencement date.

 

15. Notices. Any notice or demand which either party may or must give to the other hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered when personally delivered or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, certified with return receipt requested, addressed to the parties hereto at the respective addresses set out opposite their names below, or at such other address as they have hereafter specified by written notice:

Tenant may not exercise its Extension Right if it is then in default beyond any applicable cure period or if it has ever been in default beyond any applicable cure period more than two (2) times in any twelve (12) month period. Tenant may exercise its Extension Right by delivering written notice thereof to Landlord not later than nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the initial term. In the Extended Term, all terms and conditions of this Lease shall apply except (i) there shall be no additional renewal terms; (ii) the Base Monthly Rent for the Extended Term shall be the then prevailing Fair Market Rent, provided that in no event shall the Base Monthly Rent for the Extended Term be less than the Base Monthly Rent for the last month of the initial term; (iii) parking rates during the Extended Term shall be at the than-prevailing rates for the Building; and (iv) the Base Year and Base Year Operating Expenses shall be reset to the calendar year in which falls the first day of the Extended Term.

 

Extension Rights shall apply to all of the Premises than under lease to Tenant. Tenant’s Extension Right is personal and may not be exercised by any assignee or sublessee other than an affiliate of Tenant or a successor by merger or consolidation.

 

The term “Fair Market Rent” for the purposes of this Lease shall mean the annual amount per rentable square foot that Landlord has accepted in current, new comparable transactions in the Building for comparable space, for a comparable period of time, with improvements comparable to those existing in the Premises on the date Tenant exercises its Extension Right (or with such restoration as Tenant would be required to make upon termination of the Lease, if such would increase the Fair Market Rent) from non-expansion, non-renewal and non-equity tenants, or if there are not a sufficient number of current comparable transactions in the Building, what a willing, comparable, new, non-expansion, non-renewal, non-equity tenant would pay, and a willing, comparable landlord of a comparable building would accept under the transaction as further defined above.

 

If Landlord and Tenant are not able to agree on the Fair Market Rent for the Extended Term within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s notice of election to renew, then such Fair Market Rent shall be determined as follows. Landlord and Tenant shall each select an appraiser with at least ten years experience in the Seattle commercial market. If the two appraisers are unable to agree within ten (10) days after their selection, they shall select a similarly qualified third appraiser (the “Neutral Appraiser”). Within twenty (20) days after selection of the Neutral Appraiser, the three appraisers shall simultaneously exchange determinations of Fair Market Rent. If the lowest appraisal is not less than ninety percent (90%) if the highest appraisal, then the three appraisals shall be averaged and the result shall be the Fair Market Rent. If the lowest appraisal is less than ninety percent (90%) of the highest appraisal, then the Fair Market Rent shall be deemed the rent set forth in the appraisal submitted an appraiser appointed by a party that is closest in dollar amount to the appraisal submitted by the Neutral Appraiser.

Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand the amount of all past due Rent and other losses and damages which Landlord may suffer as a result of Tenant’s default, whether by Landlord’s inability to relet the Premises on satisfactory terms or otherwise, including, without limitation, all Costs of Reletting (defined below) and any deficiency that may arise from reletting or the failure to relet the Premises. “Costs of Reletting” shall include all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in reletting or attempting to relet the Premises, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, brokerage commissions, the cost of alterations and the value of other concessions or allowance granted to a new tenant.
 

 	20.1.2	Terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises and, in compliance with applicable Law, expel and remove Tenant, Tenant’s Property and any parties occupying all or any part of the Premises. Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to, except to the extent required by law) relet all or any part of the Premises, without notice to Tenant, for a term that may be greater or less than the balance of the Term and on such conditions (which may include concessions, free rent and alterations of the Premises) and for such uses as Landlord in its absolute discretion shall determine. Landlord may collect and receive all rents and other income from the reletting. Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand all past due Rent, all Costs of Reletting and any deficiency arising from the reletting or failure to relet the Premises. Landlord shall not be responsible or liable for the failure to relet all or any part of the Premises or for the failure to collect any Rent. The re-entry or taking of possession of the Premises shall not be construed as an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of termination is given to Tenant.
 

 	20.1.3	In the event that Landlord shall elect to terminate this Lease under Section 20.1.1, then upon such termination Tenant shall (if it has not already done so) quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord and Landlord may recover from Tenant:
 

(i) The worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; plus

 

(ii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus

 

(iii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; plus

 	 	SEPTEMBER 12, 2003
(iv) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the damage proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.

 

As used in (i) and (ii) above, the “worth at the time of award” is computed by allowing interest at 12% per annum. As used in (iii) above, the worth at the time of award” is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus 1%.

 

 	20.2	Unless expressly provided in this Lease, the repossession or re-entering of all or any part of the Premises shall not relieve Tenant of its liabilities and obligations under the Lease. No right or remedy of Landlord shall be exclusive of any other right or remedy. Each right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right and remedy now or subsequently available to Landlord at Law or in equity. If Landlord declares Tenant to be in default, Landlord shall be entitled to receive interest on any unpaid item of Rent at a rate equal to 12% per annum. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more remedies shall not constitute a waiver of any default.
 

21. Landlord’s Default; Limitation of Liability. Landlord’s failure to perform or observe any of its obligations under this Lease or to correct a breach of any warranty or representation made in this Lease within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Tenant setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and extent of the failure (or if more than thirty (30) days is required to cure the breach, Landlord’s failure to begin curing within the thirty (30) day period and diligently prosecute the cure to completion) shall constitute a default by Landlord. In no event shall Tenant have the right to terminate this Lease as a result of Landlord’s default and Tenant’s remedies shall be limited to damages and/or an injunction: and in no case may the Tenant withhold any Rent or claim a set-off or deduction from Rent. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS LEASE, THE LIABILITY OF LANDLORD (AND OF ANY SUCCESSOR LANDLORD) TO TENANT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE INTEREST OF LANDLORD IN THE PROPERTY AND ANY PROCEEDS THEREOF. TENANT SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO LANDLORD’S INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY AND ANY PROCEEDS THEREOF FOR THE RECOVERY OF ANY JUDGMENT OR AWARD AGAINST LANDLORD. NEITHER LANDLORD NOR ANY LANDLORD RELATED PARTY SHALL BE PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR ANY JUDGMENT OR DEFICIENCY. BEFORE FILING SUIT FOR AN ALLEGED DEFAULT BY LANDLORD, TENANT SHALL GIVE LANDLORD AND THE MORTGAGEE(S) (DEFINED IN ARTICLE 25 BELOW) WHOM TENANT HAS BEEN NOTIFIED HOLD MORTGAGES (DEFINED IN ARTICLE 25 BELOW) ON THE PROPERTY, BUILDING OR PREMISES, NOTICE AND REASONABLE TIME TO CURE THE ALLEGED DEFAULT. IN ADDITION, TENANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY ENTITY MANAGING THE PREMISES ON BEHALF OF LANDLORD, OR WHICH EXECUTES THIS LEASE AS AGENT FOR LANDLORD, IS ACTING SOLELY IN ITS CAPACITY AS AGENT FOR LANDLORD AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LEASE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY WAIVED BY TENANT, UNLESS DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH ENTITY OR AGENT.

 

22. No Waiver. Either party’s failure to declare a default immediately upon its occurrence, or delay in taking action for a default shall not constitute a waiver of the default, nor shall it constitute an estoppel. Either party’s failure to enforce its rights for a default shall not constitute a waiver of its rights regarding any subsequent default. Receipt by Landlord of Tenant’s keys to the Premises shall not constitute an acceptance or surrender of the Premises.

 

23. Quiet Enjoyment. Tenant shall, and may peacefully have, hold and enjoy the Premises, subject to the terms of this Lease, provided Tenant pays the Rent and fully performs all of its covenants and agreements. This covenant and all other covenants of Landlord shall be binding upon Landlord and its successors only during its or their respective periods of ownership of the Premises, and shall not be a personal covenant of Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties.

 

24. Holding Over. If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, occupancy of the Premises after the termination or expiration shall be that of a tenancy at sufferance. Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises during the holdover shall be subject to all the terms and provisions of this Lease and Tenant shall pay an amount (on a per month basis without reduction for partial months during the holdover) equal to one hundred seventy five percent (175%) of the sum of the Base Rent and Additional Rent due for the period immediately preceding the holdover. No holdover by Tenant or payment by Tenant after the expiration or early termination of this Lease shall be construed to extend the Term or prevent Landlord from immediate recovery of possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or otherwise. In addition to the payment of the amounts provided above, if Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Premises to a new tenant, or to perform improvements for a new tenant, as a result of Tenant’s holdover and Tenant fails to vacate the Premises within fifteen (15) days after Landlord notifies Tenant of Landlord’s inability to deliver possession, or perform improvements. Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for all damages, including, without limitation, consequential damages, that Landlord suffers from the holdover.

 

25.	Subordination to Mortgages; Estoppel Certificate; Mortgagee Protection.
 

 	25.1	Subject to the terms of this Section. Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage(s), deed(s) of trust or other lien(s) now or subsequently arising upon the

This clauses shall be self-operative, but upon request from a Mortgagee, Tenant shall execute and deliver a subordination agreement in favor of the Mortgagee within ten (10) business days of the request, provided that the Mortgagee shall agree, in a non-disturbance agreement, to recognize this Lease in the event of foreclosure if Tenant is not in default at such time subject to such provisions relating to the disposition or application of Insurance or condemnation proceeds as may be contained in such Mortgagee’s loan documents. Tenant agrees to execute any reasonable documents required to effectuate such subordination. In lieu of having the Mortgage be superior to this Lease, a Mortgagee shall have the right at any time to subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease. If requested by a successor-in-interest to all or a part of Landlord’s interest in the Lease, Tenant shall, without charge, attorn to the successor-in-interest. Landlord and Tenant shall each, within ten (10) business days after receipt of a written request from the other, execute and deliver an estoppel certificate to those parties as are reasonably requested by the other (including a Mortgagee or prospective purchaser). The estoppel certificate shall include a statement certifying that this Lease is unmodified (except as identified in the estoppel certificate) and in full force and affect, describing the dates to which Rent and other charges have been paid, representing that, to such party’s actual knowledge, there is no default for stating the nature of the alleged default) and indicating other matters with respect to the Lease that may reasonably be requested.
 

 	25.2	Tenant agrees to give any mortgagee or deed of trust holder, by certified mail, a copy of any notice of default served upon the Landlord, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified in writing (by way of Notice of Assignment of Rents and Leases, or otherwise) of the addresses of such mortgagee or deed of trust holder. Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within the time provided for in this Lease, then the mortgagees and/or trust deed holders have an additional thirty (30) days within which to cure such default or if such default cannot be cured within that time, then such additional time as may be necessary if within such thirty (30) days any mortgagee or deed of trust holder has commenced and is diligently pursuing the remedies necessary to cure such default (including but not limited to commencement of foreclosure proceedings if necessary to affect such cure), in which event this Lease shall not be terminated if such remedies are being so diligently pursed.
 

26. Attorneys’ Fees. If either party institutes a suit against the other for violation of or to enforce any covenant or condition of this Lease, or if either party intervenes in any suit in which the other is a party to enforce or protect its interest or rights, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all of its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees.

 

27. Notice.

Each notice shall be deemed to have been received or given on the earlier to occur of actual delivery or the date on which delivery is refused, or, if Tenant has vacated the Premises or the other Notice Address of Tenant without providing a new Notice Address, three (3) days after notice is deposited in the U.S. mail or with a courier service in the manner described above. Either party may, at any time, change its Notice Address by giving the other party written notice of the new address in the manner described in this Article.

Landlord shall also have the right to make such other changes to the Property (but not the Interior of the Premises) as Landlord deems appropriate, provided the changes do not materially affect Tenant’s ability to use or access the Premises for the Permitted Use. Landlord shall also have the right (but not the obligation) to temporarily close the Property if Landlord reasonably determines that there is an imminent danger of significant damage to the Property or of personal injury to Landlord’s employees or the occupants of the Property. The circumstances under which Landlord may temporarily close the Property shall include, without limitation, electrical interruptions, hurricanes and civil disturbances. A closure of the Property under such circumstances shall not constitute a constructive eviction nor entitle Tenant to an abatement or reduction of Rent.

Exhibit 10.1
SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT (“Sublease”) is made and entered into on the 23 day of April, by and between Workrise Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sublessor” or “Sublandlord”), and CS Disco, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“Sublessee” or “Subtenant”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Sublandlord and Cousins – One Congress Plaza LLC (“Landlord” or “Master Landlord”) entered in a lease (“Lease”) on August 20, 2018.

WHEREAS, The Lease has been amended by that certain First Amendment dated December 5, 2018 (the “First Amendment”), by that certain Second Amendment dated June 21, 2019 (the “Second Amendment”), and by that certain Third Amendment dated June 21, 2019 (the “Third Amendment”), hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Master Lease” or “Lease”, and as attached hereto as Exhibit “A”.

WHEREAS, Pursuant to the Lease, Landlord has leased to Tenant space currently containing approximately 23,108 square feet of Rentable Floor Area (the “6th Floor Space”) (being Suite Number 600) located on the entire 6th floor of the Building commonly known as One Eleven located at 111 Congress Avenue, Austin Texas 78701.

WHEREAS, Pursuant to the Lease, Landlord has leased to Tenant space currently containing approximately 23,142 square feet of Rentable Floor Area (the “9th Floor Space”) (being Suite Number 900) located on the entire 9th floor of the Building commonly known as One Eleven located at 111 Congress Avenue, Austin Texas 78701.

WHEREAS, Sublessee desires to sublet from Sublessor, and Sublessor has agreed to sublet to Sublessee, a portion of the Premises included in the Lease, specifically the 6th Floor Space and the 9th Floor Space (the “Subleased Premises”), upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Sublease.

NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration and on the terms and upon the conditions set forth herein, Sublessor and Sublessee hereby agree as follows:

1. Demise of Subleased Premises. Sublessor hereby subleases to Sublessee, and Sublessee hereby subleases from Sublessor the Subleased Premises consisting of a total of 46,250 rentable square feet (the “Subleased Premises”) on the 6th and 9th floors of the Building, as generally depicted on the floor plans attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and incorporated by this reference.

2. Master Lease.

2.1 Relationship of Sublease to Master Lease. Sublessee acknowledges that this Sublease is subject and subordinate to the Master Lease and to all the terms, covenants and conditions contained therein. To the extent that the Master Lease is also subject and




subordinate to such instruments, this Sublease is also subject and subordinate to all ground and underlying leases and all mortgages which might now or hereafter affect such leases, the leasehold estate or estates thereby created or real property of which the Subleased Premises form a part, and to any and all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof. Sublessee covenants and agrees that: (a) Sublessee shall perform and observe all of the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements of the Master Lease on the part of Sublessor as Tenant to be performed with respect to the Subleased Premises during the term of this Sublease to the extent that the same are not modified or amended by this Sublease, and (b) with respect to the Subleased Premises, Sublessee shall not knowingly do or suffer or permit anything to be done which would constitute a default under the Master Lease. Sublessor shall fully perform all of its obligations under the Master Lease to the extent Sublessee has not expressly agreed to perform such obligations under this Sublease and shall not knowingly do or suffer or permit anything to be done which would constitute a default under the Master Lease. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sublessor shall not terminate or take any actions giving rise to a termination right under the Master Lease, amend or waive any provisions under the Master Lease or make any elections, exercise any right or remedy or give any consent or approval under the Master Lease, directly related to the Sublessee continued use of the Sublease, without, in each instance, Sublessee’s prior written consent.

2.2 Utilization of Master Lease Provisions as Part of Sublease. Except as the terms and conditions set forth in this Sublease modify or contradict the terms and conditions of the Master Lease or any exhibits or attachments thereto, all of the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease are hereby made a part of this Sublease and are deemed to constitute a portion of the agreement between Sublessor and Sublessee concerning the leasing of the Subleased Premises; provided, however, that to the extent any of the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are inappropriate or inapplicable to this Sublease, such terms and provisions shall not be made a part hereof. Where reference is made in the Master Lease to the “Leased Premises” or the “Premises”, the same shall be deemed to refer to the Subleased Premises. It is further understood that (i) where reference is made in the Master Lease to the “Commencement Date” the same shall be deemed to refer to the Commencement Date hereunder, (ii) where reference is made to the “Landlord” the same shall be deemed to refer to Sublessor hereunder and (iii) where references are made in the Master Lease to “this Lease” the same shall be deemed to refer to this Sublease. It is understood by Sublessee that the services, repairs and alterations referred to herein to be furnished in accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease herein by reference incorporated will in fact be furnished by Master Landlord and not by Sublessor. Sublessor shall in no event be liable to Sublessee nor shall Sublessee’s obligations hereunder be impaired or the performance thereof excused because of any failure or delay on the Master Landlord’s part in furnishing any such service or in making any of such repairs or alterations; provided that promptly upon notice thereof from Sublessee, Sublessor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the Master Lease and cause Master Landlord to furnish such service, make such repair or alteration and otherwise comply with the obligations of Master Landlord under the Master Lease and Sublessee shall be entitled to participate with Sublessor in the enforcement of Sublessor’s rights against Master Landlord.

2.3 Master Lease in Full Force and Effect. Sublessor represents, covenants and agrees that the (a) Master Lease is in full force and effect, and there exists under the Master Lease no default by Sublessor or, to Sublessor’s knowledge, Master Landlord, nor has
2



there occurred any event which, with the giving of notice or passage of time or both, could constitute such a default by Sublessor or, to Sublessor’s knowledge, Master Landlord and (b) the copy of the Master Lease attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true, correct and complete copy of the Master Lease.

3. Effectiveness of Sublease. This Sublease shall not be in full effect unless and until Master Landlord shall have executed and delivered a Consent to Sublease (the “Master Landlord Consent”). The date of Sublessee’s receipt of the Master Landlord Consent, executed by Master Landlord, shall be the “Effective Date” of this Sublease.

4. Term; Possession and Condition of Subleased Premises.

4.1 Term. The Term (as defined herein) will commence on the later of the Effective Date and the date by which the Subleased Premises are delivered by Sublessor to Sublessee in the condition required herein (such date herein the “Commencement Date”), and shall continue on through the Master Lease expiration of July 31, 2028 (the “Expiration Date”) unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this Sublease. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sublessor shall deliver possession of the Subleased Premises to Sublessee in good, vacant, broom clean condition with any broken items such as doors or door systems fixed, all appliances therein in a clean condition, all personal belongings (including, without limitation, files and papers) removed therefrom and all Sublessor-branded signs removed therefrom. With regard to the known broken door system shown in Exhibit “E”, Sublessor agrees to the following: Sublessor shall provide Sublessee a contractor’s pricing bid to perform the work shown in Exhibit “E”. Within two (2) business days of receiving said bid, Sublessee shall provide notice to Sublessor that (i) they elect to have Sublessor perform the work, or (ii) they elect to receive an allowance equal to the amount of the bid, in which case Sublessor shall no longer be responsible for said work. If Sublessee elects option (i), Sublessor shall perform the work shown on Exhibit “E”. If Sublessee elects option (ii), then Sublessor shall pay the allowance to Sublessee within ten (10) days after Sublessee delivers either (at Sublessee’s option) (x) an invoice from a contractor or (y) certificate of substantial completion from an architect. Sublessor shall also deliver to Sublessee all keys and/or access codes needed for access to the Subleased Premises and/or the Building on the Commencement Date other than those to be provided by the Master Landlord, which Sublessor shall assist Sublessee in obtaining.

4.2 Possession. Full possession of the Subleased Premises shall be delivered to Sublessee two (2) weeks following Sublessor’s receipt of the Master Landlord Consent. If Sublessor is delayed in delivering possession of the Subleased Premises to Sublessee in the condition required herein beyond July 1, 2022, Sublessee shall be entitled to a resulting 1.0 day abatement of Basic Rental and Additional Rental due and payable with respect to the Subleased Premises for each day occurring between July 1, 2022 and the date that the Subleased Premises are delivered to Sublessee in the condition required herein.

4.3 Sublessee’s Access. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.2 of this Sublease, Sublessee shall be permitted access to the Subleased Premises beginning on the Commencement Date. Sublessee’s access shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this Sublease, inclusive of Sublessee’s obligation to pay Other Charges (defined below) to the extent incurred following the Commencement Date with respect to Sublessee’s use
3



and occupancy of the Subleased Premises. Prior to Sublessee’s access, Sublessee shall procure and deliver to Sublessor and Master Landlord duly executed originals of evidence of the insurance coverage required by the Master Lease as to the Subleased Premises. Such evidence of insurance coverage, as the case may be (i) shall name Sublessor, Master Landlord and any other party required by Master Landlord, as additional insureds thereunder, and (ii) shall be delivered to Sublessor at the address set forth in Section 12 below and to Master Landlord.

4.4 Condition of Subleased Premises. Sublessee acknowledges and agrees that (i) it accepts the Subleased Premises in “AS-IS WHERE IS” condition, and (ii) Sublessor shall have no obligation with respect to alteration to, or refurbishment of, the Subleased Premises, except as otherwise provided herein. Sublessee shall return the Subleased Premises to Sublessee at the expiration of the Sublease in the same condition found on the Commencement Date, normal wear and tear, repairs not Sublessee’s responsibility under this Sublease and alterations (provided Master Landlord does not require their removal), excepted. If required by Master Landlord under the Lease), Sublessor shall be responsible for removal of the current cabling, furniture and FFE (defined below) upon the end of this Sublease. To the extent that the Subleased Premises were not in compliance with the requirements of the Master Lease as of the Effective Date, Sublessor shall cause the Subleased Premises to comply with such requirements within a reasonable period after receipt of notice thereof from Master Landlord; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any failure of the Subleased Premises to be in compliance with the Master Lease as a result of Sublessee’s modifications to the Subleased Premises or Sublessee’s use of and/or business conducted in the Subleased Premises.

5. Rent. The term “Rent” shall mean individually or collectively the Basic Rental, Forecast Additional Rental, Additional Rental, or Other Charges or Late Charges described below.

5.1 Basic Rental. Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor basic rental (“Basic Rental”) for each portion of the Subleased Premises per table below, payable in monthly installments on the first day of each month in advance during the Term per table below:

Term		Size (per rsf)		Basic Rental Rate
Per Year		Monthly Basic Rent
Commencement - 10/31/23*		46,250		$43.50		$167,657.67
11/01/23 - 10/31/24		46,250		$44.81		$172,687.40
11/01/24 - 10/31/25		46,250		$46.15		$177,868.02
11/01/25 - 10/31/26		46,250		$47.53		$183,204.06
11/01/26 - 10/31/27		46,250		$48.96		$188,700.18
11/01/27 - 07/31/28		46,250		$50.43		$194,361.18
 

*Provided no event of default occurs during the term of the Sublease (subject to Sublessee’s ability to cure said default per terms of the Sublease and Master Lease), Sublessee’s obligation to pay Basic Rental with respect to the entire Subleased Premises shall be abated from the Commencement Date through 10/31/2022 (hereafter “Abatement Term”), following the expiration of which, Sublessee’s obligation to pay Rent shall commence.

4



Such abatement shall in no event limit Sublessor’s rights and remedies herein and as incorporated by the Lease. Basic Rental for any portion of a month which is included within the term of this Sublease shall be prorated at the rate of 1/30th of the applicable monthly rent per day. Rent shall be payable to Sublessor without notice, demand, deduction, offset or abatement (except as may expressly be provided for herein) in lawful money of the United States of America at the address set forth in Section 12 below or to such other person or at such other address as Sublessor may designate in writing, or electronically if requested by Sublessor. The parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing Abatement Term has been granted to Sublessee as additional consideration for entering into this Sublease.

5.2 Forecast Additional Rental or Additional Rental or Operating Expenses. In addition to monthly installments of Basic Rental, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor monthly payments (based on the sizes in the rental chart above) equal to its prorata share of the monthly estimated Forecast Additional Rental or Additional Rental or Operating Expenses charged by Master Landlord pursuant to the Master Lease (the “Estimated Additional Rent”). Sublessee’s share of the monthly Estimated Additional Rent for the calendar year 2022 is $29.15 per RSF or $112,348.95 per month. The parties both acknowledge and agree that this is the most up to date and accurate estimate provided by Landlord, provided that such Estimated Additional Rent is subject to change. Sublessee shall pre-pay the first month of Rent (Basic Rental and Estimated Additional Rent) at Sublease execution as prepaid rent for the first full month of rent due under the Sublease. Provided no event of default occurs during the term of the Sublease (subject to Sublessee’s ability to cure said default per terms of the Sublease and Master Lease), Sublessee’s obligation to pay the aforementioned Estimated Additional Rent shall be abated for the duration of the Abatement Term, as defined herein.

5.3 Other Charges and Late Charges. If, under the provisions of the Master Lease, any additional payments for services or other charges (e.g., late charges, additional cleaning, separately metered server room, after hours air conditioning charged at Landlord’s then quoted rate, etc) allocable in whole or in part to the Subleased Premises (such additional payments for services and other charges being hereafter collectively referred to as “Other Charges”) shall be payable by Sublessor because of Sublessee’s default hereunder or use of the Subleased Premises, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor an amount equal to such portion of the Other Charges as may be properly attributable or allocable to Sublessee’s use and occupancy of the Subleased Premises. In addition, any payment of Basic Rent or other amount from Sublessee to Sublessor or Master Landlord under this Sublease which is not paid on the date due shall accrue interest from the date due until the date paid at the amounts prescribed in the Master Lease.

5.4 Abatement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Sublease, if, as a result of casualty, condemnation or Master Lessor’s failure to provide services or perform any other obligation as required under the Master Lease to the Subleased Premises, Sublessor receives an abatement of rent for the Subleased Premises under the Master Lease or governing law, then Sublessee shall receive a corresponding abatement of the Basic Rent and Additional Rent due under this Sublease.

6. Security Deposit. Concurrently with the execution of this Sublease, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor a security deposit in the amount of $306,714.58, in the form of cash (the “Security Deposit”) for Sublessee’s faithful performance of Sublessee’s obligations
5



hereunder. If Sublessee fails to pay any amount due to be paid by Sublessee under this Sublease, Sublessor may use, apply or retain all or any portion of the Security Deposit for the payment of any Rent or other amount due and payable from Sublessee to Sublessor pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Sublease. If Sublessor uses or applies all or any portion of the Security Deposit in accordance with the preceding sentence, Sublessee shall deposit cash in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the full amount first set forth above within thirty (30) days after Sublessee’s receipt of written demand from Sublessor. Sublessee’s failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of this Sublease. Sublessor shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general funds. Provided Sublessee is not in Default and following application of the Security Deposit against any amounts due and payable from Sublessee to Sublessor in accordance with this Sublease, the Security Deposit or any remaining portion thereof shall be returned to Sublessee within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the term of this Sublease or any extensions thereof.

7. Use. The Subleased Premises may be used and occupied during the term of this Sublease only for general office purposes. Sublessee shall, to the extent required under the Master Lease, at Sublessee’s expense, comply promptly in all material respects with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, restrictions of record and requirements in effect during the Term or any part of the Term hereof regulating the use by Sublessee of the Subleased Premises.

8. Sublessee’s Indemnification. Sublessee shall hold Sublessor free and harmless from any and all, actual and anticipated, claims, liabilities, losses, suit, penalty, demand, and damages (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “Claims and Losses”) to the extent arising out of, by reason of, or resulting from (a) Sublessee’s failure to comply with any terms or perform any of the obligations contained in this Sublease; (b) Sublessee’s use of the Subleased Premises; and/or (c) any other act or omission of Sublessee, it’s successors and assigns, it’s employees, agents, contractors, visitors, or licensees, in or about the Subleased Premises; Provided that such indemnification obligations shall exclude any Claims and Losses arising solely from Sublessor’s negligence, or willful acts or omissions.

9. Default. If one or more of the following events (“Event of Default”) occurs, such occurrence constitutes a breach of this Sublease by Sublessee:

9.1 Sublessee fails to pay when due any Rent due hereunder and such failure shall continue for five (5) days after Sublessee’s receipt of written notice thereof from Sublessor, except that Sublessor or Landlord shall not be required to give such notice more than once in any twelve (12) month period;

9.2 Sublessee fails to comply with any other provision of this Sublease in the manner and within the time required, and such failure continues for twenty-seven (27) days after Sublessee’s receipt of written notice thereof from Sublessor, provided that if such failure cannot be cured within such twenty-seven (27) day period, an Event of Default shall not be deemed to have occurred so long as Sublessee commences such cure within such twenty-seven (27) day period and diligently pursues such cure to completion within fifty-seven (57) days after such notice;

6



9.3 the occurrence of default by Sublessor under the Master Lease which is the result of Sublessee’s default under this Sublease;

Any violation of any provision of this Sublease by any Sublessee shall be deemed a violation of such provision by Sublessee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, if there occurs an event of default beyond applicable notice and cure periods at any time during the Term, all unamortized Abated Rent shall immediately become due and payable by Tenant, and there shall be no further abatement pursuant to this section after such event of default if the event of default occurs during the Rent Abatement Period. The unamortized amount of Abated Rent is calculated by amortizing the aggregate amount of the Abated Rent over the number of months of the Term during which Tenant is required to pay Base Rental at the Default Rate per annum on a monthly basis and multiplying the monthly amortized amount by the number of months remaining in the Term after the applicable event of default. The payment by Tenant of the Abated Rent pursuant to the foregoing after an event of default shall not limit or affect any of Landlord's other rights or remedies pursuant to this Lease, at law or in equity.

5.Tenant's Use of Demised Premises. The Demised Premises may be used for executive, general administrative and office space purposes and no other purposes and in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of governmental authorities and the Rules and Regulations attached hereto as Exhibit ""G” and made a part hereof. The occupancy rate of the Demised Premises
5



may not exceed one (1) person per 150 square feet of Rentable Floor Area within the Demised Premises. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 5 to the contrary, in no event shall the Demised Premises be used for (i) an employment agency, (ii) a dental, medical or chiropractic office, or medical marijuana dispensary or clinic, (iii) a governmental office, subdivision or agency, or (iv) any other purpose which would, in Landlord's reasonable opinion, impair the reputation or quality of the Building, overburden any of the Building systems, Common Areas or parking facilities (including any use which would create a population density in the Premises which is in excess of the density which is standard for the Building), impair Landlord's efforts to lease space or otherwise interfere with the operation of the Project. Tenant covenants and agrees to abide by the Rules and Regulations in all respects as now set forth and attached hereto or as hereafter promulgated by Landlord. Landlord may at all times during the Lease Term publish and promulgate and thereafter enforce such rules and regulations or changes in the existing Rules and Regulations as it may reasonably deem necessary in its sole discretion to protect the tenantability, safety, operation, and welfare of the Demised Premises and the Project.

6.Security Deposit. As security for the faithful performance by Tenant throughout the Lease Term, and any extensions or renewals thereof, of all the terms and conditions of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord the sum set forth in Section 4 of Exhibit ""J"" above upon the execution of this Lease by Tenant. Such amount will be returned to Tenant, without interest, within thirty (30) days after the day set for the expiration of the Lease Term, or any extension or renewal thereof, provided Tenant has fully and faithfully observed and performed all of the terms, covenants, agreements, warranties and conditions hereof on its part to be observed and performed. Landlord will have the right, at any time, to apply all or any part of said deposit toward the cure of any default of Tenant, the repair of any damage to the Demised Premises or otherwise caused by Tenant, or the amount of any Rent owing under this Lease. No application of the security deposit should be construed to limit Landlord's right under applicable law to recover additional sums from Tenant for damages to the Demised Premises. If all or any part of said security deposit is so applied by Landlord, then Tenant shall immediately pay to Landlord an amount sufficient to return said security deposit to the balance on deposit with Landlord prior to said application. In no event will Tenant be entitled to apply the security deposit to any Rent due hereunder. In the event of an act of bankruptcy by or insolvency of Tenant, or the appointment of a receiver for Tenant or a general assignment for the benefit of Tenant's creditors, then the security deposit will be deemed immediately assigned to Landlord. The right to retain the security deposit will be in addition and not alternative to Landlord's other remedies under this Lease or as may be provided by law and will not be affected by summary proceedings or other proceedings to recover possession of the Demised Premises. In the event of a sale or transfer of Landlord's interest in the Demised Premises or the Building or a lease by Landlord of the Building, Landlord will have the right to transfer the within described security deposit to the purchaser or lessee, as the case may be, and Landlord will be relieved of all liability to Tenant for the return of such security deposit. Tenant shall look solely to the new owner or lessee for the return of said security deposit. The security deposit may not be mortgaged, assigned or encumbered by Tenant. Landlord is not required to keep the security deposit separate from its general accounts.

7.Services by Landlord. Landlord shall provide the Building Standard Services described on Exhibit “F"" attached hereto and by reference made a part hereof. Services requested or required to be supplied to Tenant in excess of the Building Standard Services will be at Tenant's sole cost and expense and will be paid for by Tenant promptly upon invoice therefor, which invoice may include Landlord's administrative fee. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Lease, nothing in this Lease will be deemed to require Landlord to provide to Tenant services in excess of the Building Standard Services.

8.Repairs and Alterations.

(a)Landlord shall maintain in good order and repair, subject to normal wear and tear and subject to casualty and condemnation, (i) the structural elements of the Building; (ii) standard mechanical (including HVAC), electrical, plumbing and fire/life safety systems serving the Building in general; (iii) the Common Areas; (iv) the roof of the Building; (v) the exterior windows of the Building; and (vi) the elevators serving the Building. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation, the cost of any repairs or maintenance to the foregoing necessitated by the intentional acts or negligence of Tenant or its directors, officers, partners, members, shareholders, representatives, agents, contractors, employees, servants, invitees, patrons, guests, visitors, licensees, subtenants, assignees, and any other party for whom Tenant is or may become liable or responsible (each and together herein referred to as ""Tenant's Agents”), will be borne solely by Tenant and will be deemed Rent hereunder and must be reimbursed by Tenant to Landlord upon demand.

(b)Tenant covenants and agrees that it will take good care of the Demised Premises and all alterations, additions and improvements thereto and will keep and maintain the same in good condition and repair, except for normal wear and tear. Tenant shall periodically inspect the Demised Premises to identify any conditions that are dangerous or in need of maintenance or repair and shall promptly provide Landlord with notice of any such conditions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tenant hereby waives all rights to make repairs at the expense of Landlord or in lieu thereof to vacate the Demised Premises as may be provided by any law, statute or ordinance now or hereafter in effect. Landlord has no obligation and has made no promise to alter, remodel, improve, repair, decorate or paint the Demised Premises or any part thereof, except as specifically and expressly herein set forth.

(c)Tenant will be responsible for stopped up drains where such stoppage is caused by the introduction from within the Demised Premises of foreign objects not intended for disposal in such drains. If Landlord repairs such drains, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as additional Rent, for the costs of such repairs, together with the costs of any repairs or damage to the Demised Premises or the Building and to the property of other tenants or Landlord which results from such stoppage.

(d)After the initial improvements to the Demised Premises as provided in Exhibit ""E"" attached hereto, Tenant may not make, suffer or permit to be made any alterations, additions or improvements to or of the Demised Premises or any part thereof, or attach any fixtures or equipment thereto (collectively, ""Alterations""), without first obtaining Landlord's written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. However, Landlord's consent shall not be required for any Alteration that satisfies all of the following criteria (a ""Permitted Alterations""): (i) is of a cosmetic nature such as painting, wallpapering, hanging pictures and installing carpeting; (ii) is not visible from outside the Demised Premises or Building; (iii) will not affect the systems or structure of the Building; (d) does not require work to be performed inside the walls or above the ceiling of the Demised Premises; and (e) does not require securing a building permit from the local authority having jurisdiction over such alterations, additions or improvements. For all alterations, additions or improvements other than Permitted Alterations, complete architectural and engineering drawings must be submitted for Landlord's approval. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice for reasonable out-of-pocket sums paid by Landlord for third party examination of Tenant's plans for Alterations. In addition, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a fee equal to five percent (5%) of the total cost of such Alterations for Landlord's oversight and coordination of any Alterations, however, only in the event the project scope exceeds $20,000. All Alterations will become Landlord1s property at the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term and will remain on the Demised Premises without compensation to Tenant unless, Landlord elects by written notice to Tenant, such written notice to be provided at the time Landlord consents to such Alteration, to have Tenant remove such Alteration, in which event, notwithstanding any contrary provisions respecting such alterations, additions and improvements contained in Article 27 hereof, Tenant shall remove such Alteration on or prior to the expiration or earlier termination of
7



the Lease Term and repair any damage to the Demised Premises resulting from the removal of same.

9.Entry by Landlord. Landlord may retain duplicate keys to all doors of the Demised Premises and Landlord and its agents, employees and independent contractors will have the right to enter the Demised Premises at reasonable hours to inspect or show the same, to make repairs, additions, alterations, and improvements to any portion of the Building, including other tenants' premises, all without being liable to Tenant in any manner whatsoever for any damages arising therefrom; provided, however, that Landlord shall, except in case of emergency, afford Tenant such prior notification of an entry into the Demised Premises as may be reasonably practicable under the circumstances. Landlord will be allowed to take into and through the Demised Premises any and all materials that may be required to make such repairs, additions, alterations or improvements. During such time as such work is being carried on in or about the Demised Premises, the Rent provided herein will not abate, and Tenant waives any claim or cause of action against Landlord for damages by reason of interruption of Tenant's business or loss of profits therefrom because of the prosecution of any such work or any part thereof. Landlord does hereby agree to use all reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with Tenant's business caused by any such entry.

10.Assignment and Subletting.

(a)Except as expressly provided herein, Tenant agrees that Tenant will not, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as Tenant complies with this Article 10, assign this Lease or any interest herein or in the Demised Premises, or mortgage, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or grant any license or concession or otherwise transfer or sublet the Demised Premises or any part thereof or permit the use of the Demised Premises by any party other than Tenant. Consent by Landlord to one or more such transfers or subleases will not destroy or waive this provision, and all subsequent transfers and subleases may likewise be made only upon obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord which also may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as Tenant complies with this Article 10. Without limiting the foregoing prohibition, in no event may Tenant assign this Lease or any interest herein, whether directly, indirectly or by operation of law, or sublet the Demised Premises or any part thereof or permit the use of the Demised Premises or any part thereof by any party, (i) if the proposed assignee or subtenant is a party who would (or whose use would) detract from the character of the Building as a first-class building, such as, without limitation, an employment agency, a dental, medical or chiropractic office, a medical marijuana dispensary or clinic, or a governmental office, (ii) if the proposed use of the Demised Premises would involve an occupancy rate of more than one (I) person per 150 square feet of Rentable Floor Area of the Demised Premises, (iii) if the proposed assignment or subletting would be to a governmental subdivision or agency or any Person who enjoys diplomatic or sovereign immunity, (iv) if such proposed assignee or subtenant is an existing tenant of the Building, (v) if such proposed assignment, subletting or use would contravene any restrictive covenant (including any exclusive use) granted to any other tenant of the Building or (vi) if (I) Tenant advertised or asked for an effective rental rate for such assignment or subletting that is less than the effective rental rate then being offered by Landlord for vacant space in the Building or (2) the effective rental rate accepted by Tenant under such assignment or subletting would be less than ninety percent (90%) of the effective rental rate then being offered by Landlord for vacant space in the Building. Sublessees or transferees of the Demised Premises for the balance of the Lease Term will become directly liable to Landlord for all obligations of Tenant hereunder, without relieving Tenant (or any guarantor of Tenant's obligations hereunder) of any liability therefor, and Tenant will remain obligated for all liability to Landlord arising under this Lease during the entire remaining Lease Term including any extensions thereof, whether or not authorized herein. If Tenant is a partnership, professional association or a limited liability company, a withdrawal or change, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, of partners or members owning a controlling interest in the Tenant or having the power to manage the business of Tenant will be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the foregoing provisions. If Tenant is a corporation, any dissolution, merger, consolidation or other reorganization of Tenant, or the sale or transfer of a controlling interest in the capital stock of Tenant, will be deemed a voluntary assignment of this Lease and subject to the foregoing provisions.

8



(b)As a condition to considering any request for consent to an assignment or sublease, Tenant must submit a written request (""Request to Assign"") to Landlord at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date Tenant desires to make such an assignment or sublease. Tenant's Request to Assign must specify the terms of said proposed sublease or assignment, including the proposed effective date thereof, and the name and address of each proposed subtenant or assignee. Landlord may require Tenant to obtain and submit current financial statements of any proposed assignee (including, without limitation, current financial statements of any prospective guarantor). Landlord will then have a period of fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of Tenant's Request to Assign within which to notify Tenant in writing whether Landlord elects to: (i) cancel and terminate this Lease as to the space so affected as of the proposed effective date so specified by Tenant in its notice, in which event Tenant will be relieved of all obligations hereunder as to such space (provided however, if Landlord so elects to cancel and terminate this Lease, Tenant may withdraw its Request to Assign by giving Landlord written notice thereof within ten (10) days after receipt of Landlord's election, in which case Landlord will be deemed to have rejected Tenant's proposed assignment or sublease and this Lease will remain in full force and effect with respect to such space); (ii) permit Tenant to assign this Lease or sublet such space for the duration specified by Tenant in its notice; or (iii) reject the proposed assignment or sublease. If Landlord fails to notify Tenant in writing of its election within the fifteen (15) Business Day period, Landlord will be deemed to elect option (iii). If Landlord consents to an assignment or sublease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a $2,500 fee to cover Landlord's administrative costs and accounting and legal costs (whether provided by Landlord's employees or by third parties) in connection with reviewing and approving the assignment or sublease. Landlord may require an additional security deposit or other form of credit enhancement acceptable to Landlord (including, by way of example and not in limitation, an irrevocable letter of credit, personal guaranties or other collateral in such form and amounts as may be acceptable to Landlord) as a condition of its consent. No assignment of this Lease consented to by Landlord will be effective unless and until Landlord receives an original assignment and assumption agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord, signed by Tenant and Tenant's proposed assignee, whereby the assignee assumes due performance of this Lease to be done and performed for the balance of the then remaining Lease Term of this Lease. No subletting of the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, will be effective unless Tenant delivers to Landlord an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord, signed by Tenant and the proposed sublessee, whereby the sublessee acknowledges the right of Landlord to continue or terminate any sublease, in Landlord's sole discretion, upon termination of this Lease, and such sublessee agrees to recognize and attorn to Landlord in the event that Landlord elects under such circumstances to continue such sublease.

(c)If Landlord exercises its right as of the effective date of such assignment, sublease or other transaction to cancel and terminate this Lease as set forth in subparagraph (b) above, Landlord will not be obligated to pay any consideration to effect such cancellation as to the portion of the Demised Premises and Lease Term with respect to which Landlord has been requested to permit such assignment, sublease or other transaction; and if Landlord elects to cancel and terminate this Lease as to the aforesaid portion of the Demised Premises and for the term proposed to be assigned or subleased, then the Base Rental and other charges payable hereunder will thereafter be proportionally reduced.

(d)If an assignment or sublease is consented to by Landlord under this Article, Tenant and Landlord agree that fifty percent (50%) of all Net Profit actually received by Tenant from such sublease or assignment will be paid by Tenant to Landlord as an additional Rent hereunder as and when received by Tenant. For purposes hereof, the term ""Net Profit"" means the gross revenue received from the assignee or sublessee, less (i) the Rent paid to Landlord by Tenant with respect to the subleased space during the period of the sublease term or attributable to the period from and after the effective date of the assignment; (ii) the Rent paid to Landlord by Tenant with respect to the subleased space or the space subject to such assignment during the period between the date Tenant ceased all business operations in such space and the commencement of the sublease term or the effective date of the assignment; (iii) any improvement allowance or other economic concession (planning allowance, moving expenses, etc.) actually paid by Tenant to the sublessee or assignee, (iv) reasonable brokerage commissions or attorney's fees actually paid in connection with such sublease or assignment; (v) lease takeover payments and reasonable costs of advertising the space for sublease or assignment actually paid by Tenant; and (vi) the unamortized cost of initial and subsequent improvements to the Demised Premises made by Tenant at Tenant's expense (and without reimbursement from the Construction Allowance or otherwise). When a
9



portion of the Demised Premises is sublet, in calculating Net Profit from such sublease, the cost under clause (vi) of the preceding sentence will be allocated on a fair and equitable basis.

(e)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, if Tenant assigns this Lease or sublets the Demised Premises in contravention of this Article 10, or if Tenant otherwise, by operation of law, ceases to be the sole occupant of the Demised Premises without the consent of Landlord, the same will be deemed a material default of Tenant, and, in addition to any other rights or remedies Landlord may have with respect to such default, Landlord may also charge and collect from Tenant (and/or the occupant of the Demised Premises) as Rent, an amount equal to 150% of the Rent otherwise reserved and payable under this Lease until such time as Tenant has caused compliance with the terms of this Lease. Occupancy or possession of the Demised Premises will cause said unapproved assignee, sublessee or occupant to be liable directly to Landlord for all amounts chargeable under this Lease, without the granting thereto of right of possession of the Demised Premises. Acceptance by Landlord of any Rent payable hereunder made by anyone other than Tenant as named herein will under no circumstances in and of itself be deemed an approval by Landlord of any assignment or subletting that may be effected without compliance with this Article 10.

(f)Tenant may assign its entire interest under this Lease to its Affiliate or to a successor to Tenant by purchase, merger, consolidation or reorganization without the consent of Landlord, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied in Landlord's reasonable discretion (a ""Permitted Transfer""): (1) no uncured event of default exists under this Lease; (2) Tenant's successor shall own all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant; (3) such Affiliate or Tenant's successor shall have a tangible net worth which is at least equal to the greater of Tenant's tangible net worth at the date of this Lease or Tenant's tangible net worth as of the day prior to the proposed purchase, merger, consolidation or reorganization; (4) no portion of the Building or Demised Premises would likely become subject to additional or different laws as a consequence of the proposed Transfer; (5) such Affiliate's or Tenant's successor's use of the Demised Premises shall not conflict with the permitted use or any exclusive usage rights granted to any other tenant in the Building; (6) such Affiliate or Tenant's successor is not and has not been involved in litigation with Landlord or any of Landlord's Affiliates; (7) Tenant will not be released if Tenant exists as a separate legal entity following the transfer; and (8) Tenant shall give Landlord written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the proposed transfer, along with all applicable documentation and other information necessary for Landlord to determine that the requirements of this Article 10(f) have been satisfied, including if applicable, the qualification of such proposed transferee as an Affiliate of Tenant.

11.Tenant's Insurance. Tenant shall procure at its expense and maintain throughout the Lease Term the following insurance: (a) commercial general liability insurance, insuring Tenant, Landlord and any other Person designated by Landlord, against any and all liability for injury to or death of a person or persons and for damage to property occasioned by or arising out of any construction work being done on the Demised Premises, or arising out of the condition, use, or occupancy of the Demised Premises, or in any way occasioned by or arising out of the activities of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents in the Demised Premises, or other portions of the Building or the Project, the limits of such policy or policies to be in combined single limits for both damage to property and personal injury and in amounts not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) for each occurrence (an umbrella policy can be used to satisfy this limit requirement); (b) special form/all-risk insurance insuring the full replacement cost of its furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies, and other property owned, leased, held or possessed by it and contained in the Demised Premises, together with the excess value of the improvements to the Demised Premises over the Construction Allowance (with a replacement cost endorsement sufficient to prevent Tenant from becoming a co-insurer); (c) business income (formerly ""business interruption"") insurance written on an actual loss sustained form or with sufficient limits to address reasonably anticipated business interruption losses; and (d) worker's compensation insurance as required by applicable law. Tenant shall also carry such other types of insurance in form and amount which Landlord reasonably deems to be prudent for Tenant to carry, should the circumstances or conditions so merit Tenant carrying such type of insurance. All insurance policies procured and maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Article 11 must name Landlord and any additional parties designated by Landlord as additional insureds, be carried with companies licensed to do business in the state in which the Project is located having a rating from Best's Insurance Reports of not less than A-/VIII, and be non-cancelable and not subject to material change
10



except after thirty (30) days' written notice to Landlord (which written notice may be provided by Tenant's insurance carrier or by Tenant). Such policies or duly executed certificates of insurance with respect thereto, accompanied by proof of payment of the premium therefor, must be delivered to Landlord prior to the Rental Commencement Date, and renewals of such policies must be delivered to Landlord at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of each respective policy term (which written notice may be provided by Tenant's insurance carrier or by Tenant).

12.Landlord's Insurance. Landlord shall procure and maintain at its expense (but with the expense to be included in Operating Expenses) throughout the Lease Term a policy or policies of special form/all-risk (including rent loss coverage) real and personal property insurance covering the Project (including the leasehold improvements in the Demised Premises up to the amount of the Construction Allowance, but excluding Tenant's personal property and equipment), in an amount equal to the full insurable replacement cost thereof as such may increase from time to time (but such insurance may provide for a commercially reasonable deductible), and in an amount sufficient to comply with any co-insurance requirements in such policy, and a policy of workers' compensation insurance, if any, as required by applicable law. In addition, Landlord shall procure and maintain at its expense (but with the expense to be included in Operating Expenses) and shall thereafter maintain throughout the Lease Term, a commercial general liability insurance policy covering the Project with combined single limits for both damage to property and personal injury of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence, subject to annual aggregate limits of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Landlord may also carry such other types of insurance in form and amounts which Landlord determines to be appropriate from time to time, and the cost thereof will be included in Operating Expenses. All such policies procured and maintained by Landlord pursuant to this Article 12 must be carried with companies licensed to do business in the state of in which the Project is located. Any insurance required to be carried by Landlord hereunder may be carried under blanket policies covering other properties of Landlord and/or its partners and/or their respective related or affiliated corporations so long as such blanket policies provide insurance at all times for the Project as required by this Lease.

13.Mutual Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord and Tenant shall each have included in all policies of fire, extended coverage, general liability, business income and loss of rents insurance respectively obtained by them covering the Demised Premises, the Building and contents therein, a waiver by the insurer of all right of subrogation against the other in connection with any loss or damage thereby insured against. Any additional premium for such waiver will be paid by the primary insured. To the full extent permitted by law, Landlord and Tenant each waives all right of recovery against the other for, and agrees to release the other from liability for, loss or damage to the extent such loss or damage is covered by valid and collectible insurance in effect at the time of such loss or damage or would be covered by the insurance required to be maintained under this Lease by the party seeking recovery.

11




14.Liability of Tenant. Subject to Article 13 hereof, Tenant hereby indemnifies Landlord from and agrees to hold Landlord harmless against, any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, imposed on Landlord by any Person whomsoever, (a) caused in whole or in part by, due to, occasioned by, or directly or indirectly related to any act or omission of Tenant, or any of Tenant's Agents, (b) resulting or arising from or connected with injury or damage to person or property that occurs in or about the Demised Premises, (c) otherwise occurring in connection with any use of the Demised Premises by Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents or any breach, default, violation or non-performance of any term, provision, covenant or condition on the part of Tenant or any of Tenant's Agents hereunder, or (d) any violation by Tenant or Tenant's Agents of any law, ordinance or governmental order of any kind or of any of the Rules and Regulations. Except as may be provided in Article 13 above, the provisions of this Article 14 shall not apply to damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its agents, employees or contractors acting within the scope of their agency or employment. The provisions of this Article 14 will survive any termination of this Lease.

15.Casualty.

(a)Landlord's Termination Rights.

(i) If the Project or any portion thereof is substantially damaged by fire, storm, wind, water, any act of nature or God, or any other matter beyond the control of Landlord (a “Casualty"") not required to be insured against by Landlord hereunder or if the Project or any portion thereof is substantially damaged by Casualty required to be insured against by Landlord but the insurance company is insolvent and financially unable to pay the proceeds which are due (through no fault of Landlord), Landlord will have the right to terminate this Lease by notice to Tenant given within ninety (90) days after the date of such Casualty (the “Damage Date""), provided, however, Landlord will not terminate this Lease pursuant to this subparagraph (a) unless Landlord terminates the leases of all tenants of the Building whose premises (or access thereto) are similarly affected by such Casualty. As used in this Article, the term ""substantially damaged"" means such damage that the cost of repair and restoration thereof is reasonably estimated by Landlord's architect to exceed Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).

(ii)If the entire Building or a substantial portion thereof (which may or may not include all or a part of the Demised Premises), or the Building systems or structural components of the Building (whether or not the Demised Premises are directly affected) are substantially damaged or destroyed and such damage or destruction is to the extent that in the reasonable opinion of Landlord's architect delivered in writing to both parties within sixty (60) days after the Damage Date, the damage cannot be repaired or restored within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the Damage Date, Landlord may terminate this Lease by giving Tenant notice within eighty (80) days after the Damage Date; provided, however, Landlord agrees that it will not terminate this Lease pursuant to this subparagraph (b) unless Landlord terminates the leases of all tenants of the Building whose premises (or access thereto) are similarly affected by such Casualty.

(iii)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article to the contrary, if Landlord is obligated to restore the Demised Premises or any part of the Project as a result of a Casualty, and (A) if the cost of performing such restoration exceeds the actual proceeds of insurance paid or payable to Landlord on account of such Casualty by more than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (""Landlord's Required Contribution""), or (B) if Landlord's mortgagee or the lessor under a ground or underlying lease requires that any insurance proceeds from a Casualty be paid to it and the cost of such restoration exceeds the actual proceeds of insurance received by Landlord and not paid to such mortgagee or lessor by more than Landlord's Required Contribution, Landlord may terminate this Lease unless Tenant, within twenty (20) days after demand therefor, deposits with Landlord a sum of money sufficient to pay the difference between (Y) the cost of restoration and (Z) the sum of Landlord's Contribution and the proceeds of the insurance received by and available to Landlord for such restoration. In the event Tenant makes such deposit pursuant to the preceding sentence in order to avoid the termination of this Lease, Tenant will have the right to
12



set off up to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) of the amount so deposited by Tenant against the Rent next thereafter coming due under this Lease. Landlord agrees that Landlord will not terminate this Lease pursuant to this subparagraph (c) unless Landlord terminates the leases of all tenants of the Building whose premises (or access thereto) is similarly affected by such Casualty.

(b)Tenant's Termination Rights. If the Demised Premises are damaged or destroyed by Casualty, or if any portion of the Project other than the Demised Premises (including, without limitation, the Building or the Parking Facility) is damaged by Casualty such that Tenant's use or enjoyment of or access to the Demised Premises or the Project is materially adversely affected and if, in the reasonable opinion of Landlord's architect, given in writing to both parties within sixty (60) days after the Damage Date, the Demised Premises and such other portions of the Project cannot be repaired or restored to the condition in all material respects that existed prior to the Casualty within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the Damage Date, Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving notice to Landlord within ninety (90) days after the Damage Date. In addition to the termination right granted to Tenant under the preceding sentence, if the Demised Premises are damaged or destroyed by Casualty, or if any portion of the Project other than the Demised Premises is damaged by Casualty such that Tenant's use or enjoyment of or access to the Demised Premises or the Project is materially adversely affected, and if the Demised Premises and/or such portion of the Project are not materially restored by Landlord to the extent required of Landlord hereunder on or before the date which is fourteen (14) months after the Damage Date, Tenant will have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice thereof to Landlord on or before the earlier to occur of (i) the date which is sixteen (16) months after the Damage Date, or (ii) the date Landlord has substantially completed the restoration of the Demised Premises and any portion of the Building required for access to the Demised Premises, as the case may be; provided, however, if construction or reconstruction is delayed because of changes, deletions or additions in construction requested by Tenant, or because of delays caused by force majeure, the fourteen (14) month period for restoration, repair or rebuilding will be extended for the amount of time Landlord is so delayed, but unless the delay is caused by Tenant or its employees or by Tenant's agents or contractors (acting within the scope of their agency or contract), the extension under this proviso will not exceed an additional two (2) months.

If Landlord's architect determines that the Demised Premises and/or Project cannot be repaired or restored to the condition in all material respects that existed prior to the Casualty within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the Damage Date, Landlord's architect shall specify in its opinion the additional time reasonably required for such repairs or restoration. In the event Tenant has the right in such circumstance to terminate this Lease pursuant to the preceding grammatical paragraph, but Tenant does not elect to so terminate this Lease, the fourteen (14) and sixteen (16)-month periods described in the preceding paragraph will each be extended by such additional time so specified in the opinion of Landlord's architect.

(c)Termination Rights During Last Two (2) Years. Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, if the Building is substantially damaged or destroyed by Casualty at any time during the last two (2) years of the Lease Term, and Landlord elects not to rebuild and restore the leasehold improvements in the Demised Premises for Tenant, then Landlord may terminate this Lease upon notice to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the Damage Date provided that if Landlord exercises such election to terminate and Tenant has any unexercised option to extend the Lease Term, then Tenant may nullify Landlord's asserted termination of this Lease by exercising Tenant's right to extend the Lease Term, for the Extended Term within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord's notice of termination. Also, notwithstanding anything in this Article 15 to the contrary, if either the Demised Premises is materially damaged or destroyed by Casualty, or if any portion of the Building or Project other than the Demised Premises (including the Parking Facility) is damaged or destroyed by Casualty so that Tenant's use or enjoyment of or access to the Demised Premises is materially adversely affected, and such Casualty occurs during the last two (2) years of the Lease Term, Tenant may terminate this Lease upon notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the Damage Date, provided that Tenant reasonably determines that the continuation of this Lease is impracticable giving due consideration to the Lease Term which would remain after restoration.
13




(d)Landlord's Restoration Obligations. If neither Landlord nor Tenant has the right to terminate this Lease pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article, or if the party or parties that have the right to terminate this Lease do not exercise such right as hereinabove provided, Landlord shall have the property damaged by such Casualty repaired or restored to the condition in all material respects that existed prior to the Casualty at the sole expense of Landlord but Landlord's repair obligations as to the leasehold improvements will be limited to the insurance proceeds actually received by Landlord for such repairs. Tenant shall pay all other costs of repairing the leasehold improvements in the Demised Premises. An equitable abatement in Rent will be allowed from the Damage Date for Tenant's loss of use or access until such time that the damage has been repaired or restored in all material respects to its condition prior to the Casualty. Landlord's architect will deliver a notice to both parties within sixty (60) days after the Damage Date stating the time required to repair and restore the damage caused by any Casualty and if Landlord is obligated hereunder to repair and restore such damage, Landlord shall use all reasonable efforts in good faith to repair and restore such damage within the estimated time period, subject to Tenant's rights under Article l5(b) hereof.

(e)Landlord's Architect; Termination Conditions. The opinions of and notices from Landlord's architect contemplated in Articles l5(a), l5(b) and l5(d) hereof will be rendered or given, as the case may be, by a reputable, qualified, licensed architect selected by Landlord. In the event of any termination of this Lease by either party pursuant to this Article, Base Rental, Tenant's Forecast Additional Rental, and Tenant's Additional Rental and any other payments due hereunder will be apportioned and paid to the date of termination and Tenant shall vacate the Demised Premises as soon as reasonably possible following the date of such termination (but in no event later than thirty [30] days after Tenant is permitted access to the Demised Premises following termination); provided, however, that those matters of this Lease which are designated to cover matters of termination and the period thereafter will survive the termination hereof.

(f)Reaffirmation of Lease. Upon the occurrence of any damage to, or destruction of the Demised Premises or any portion of the Project other than the Demised Premises which materially, adversely affects Tenant's use or enjoyment of, or access to, the Demised Premises, and provided that either Tenant does not have the right hereunder to terminate this Lease as a result of such damage or Tenant does have the right hereunder to terminate this Lease but has elected not to (or has failed to) terminate this Lease as provided herein, Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by Tenant of a written request therefor from Landlord and the receipt by Tenant from Landlord or Landlord's architect, as the case may be, of all notices, elections and other information Tenant may reasonably require in order to make any election permitted under this Article, provide Landlord with a written reaffirmation of this Lease, including an acknowledgment that Tenant does not have the right to terminate this Lease as a result of such damage or that Tenant had the right to terminate this Lease but has elected not to (or has failed to) terminate this Lease as herein provided.

16.Eminent Domain. Either party may terminate this Lease if the whole or any material part of the Demised Premises are taken or condemned for any public or quasi-public use under applicable law, by eminent domain or private purchase in lieu thereof, such that Tenant's use or enjoyment of or access to the Demised Premises or the Project is materially adversely affected (a ""Taking""). Landlord shall also have the right to terminate this Lease if there is a Taking of any portion of the Building or Project which would leave the remainder of the Building unsuitable for use as an office building in a manner comparable to the Building's use prior to the Taking. In order to exercise its right to terminate this Lease under this Article 16, Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, must provide written notice of termination to the other within 45 days after the terminating party first receives notice of the Taking. Any such termination shall be effective as of the date the physical taking of the Demised Premises or the portion of the Building or Project occurs. If this Lease is not terminated, the Rentable Floor Area of the Demised Premises and the Building and Tenant's pro rata share shall, if applicable, be appropriately adjusted by Landlord. In addition, Base Rent for any portion of the Demised Premises taken or condemned shall be abated during the unexpired Lease Term effective when the physical taking of the portion of the Demised Premises occurs. All compensation awarded for a Taking, or sale proceeds, shall be the property of Landlord, any right to receive compensation or proceeds being expressly waived by Tenant. However, Tenant may file a
14



separate claim at its sole cost and expense for Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment, furniture and other personal property within the Demised Premises (excluding above building standard leasehold improvements) and Tenant's reasonable relocation expenses, provided the filing of such claim does not diminish the award which would otherwise be receivable by Landlord.

17.Default.

(a)The following acts, events or conditions will be deemed to be events of default by Tenant under this Lease:

(i)Tenant fails to pay any installment of Rent or any other charge or assessment against Tenant after the due date thereof and such failure continues for ten (10) days after notice of such failure of payment; provided, however, such notice and such grace period will be required of Landlord only one (1) time during any calendar year, and an event of default will immediately occur upon the second (2nd) failure by Tenant to make a timely payment as aforesaid within that calendar year;

(ii)the failure by Tenant to cease any conduct prohibited by this Lease within three (3) days after receipt of written notice from Landlord requesting cessation thereof, or the failure of Tenant to cease any conduct or eliminate any condition which poses a danger to person or property within twelve (12) hours of receipt of written notice from Landlord requesting cessation of such conduct or elimination of such conditions;

(iii)Tenant or any Guarantor becomes insolvent, files a petition for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or similar law) or a petition is filed against Tenant or any Guarantor under such laws and is not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the date of such filing, makes a transfer in fraud of creditors or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or admits in writing its inability to pay its debts when due;

(iv)a receiver or trustee is appointed for the Demised Premises or for all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant or of any guarantor of this Lease;

(v)Tenant creates or permits anything to be done that creates a lien upon the Demised Premises or the Project and such lien is not removed or discharged within twenty (20) days after the filing thereof;

(vi)Tenant fails to return a properly executed instrument(s) to Landlord in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 hereof within the time period provided for such return following Landlord1s request for same as provided in Article 24;

(vii)Tenant fails to comply with any other term, provision, covenant or warranty made under this Lease by Tenant, other than the payment of the Rent or any other charge or assessment payable by Tenant, and does not cure such failure within thirty (30) days after notice thereof to Tenant; provided, however, that if any such failure is curable but not capable of being cured within such thirty (30) day period, no event of default will have occurred if Tenant commences its efforts to cure such failure within such thirty (30) day period and diligently and continuously pursues such cure to completion within sixty (60) days after such notice; and

(b)Upon the occurrence of any of the aforesaid events of default, Landlord will have the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies without any notice or demand whatsoever:

(i)terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant is required to immediately surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord and if Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may, without further notice and without prejudice to any other remedy Landlord may have for possession or arrearages in Rent, enter upon and take possession of the Demised Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other Person who may be occupying said Demised Premises or any part thereof, and its and their effects, without being liable for prosecution or any claim of damages therefor; Tenant hereby agreeing to pay to Landlord on
15



demand the amount of all loss and damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of such termination, whether through inability to relet the Demised Premises on satisfactory terms or otherwise;

(ii)terminate Tenant's right of possession, without terminating this Lease, and enter upon and take possession of the Demised Premises as Tenant's agent and expel or remove Tenant and any other Person who may be occupying said Demised Premises or any part thereof, and its and their effects, by entry, dispossessory suit or otherwise, without thereby releasing Tenant from any liability hereunder, without terminating this Lease, and without being liable for prosecution or any claim of damages therefor and, if Landlord so elects, make such alterations, redecorations and repairs as, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, may be necessary or desired to relet the Demised Premises, and Landlord may, but will be under no obligation to do so (except to the extent required by applicable laws), relet the Demised Premises or any portion thereof in Landlord's or Tenant's name, but for the account of Tenant, for such term or terms (which may be for a term extending beyond the Lease Term) and at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms as Landlord may deem advisable, with or without advertisement, and by private negotiations, and receive the rent therefor, Tenant hereby agreeing to pay to Landlord the deficiency, if any, between all Rent reserved hereunder and the total rental applicable to the Lease Term hereof obtained by Landlord upon reletting, and Tenant will be liable for Landlord's damages and expenses in redecorating and restoring the Demised Premises and all actual costs incident to such reletting, including broker's commissions and lease assumptions. In no event will Tenant be entitled to any rentals received by Landlord in excess of the amounts due by Tenant hereunder. Any such demand, reentry and taking of possession of the Demised Premises by Landlord will not of itself constitute an acceptance by Landlord of a surrender of the Lease or of the Demised Premises by Tenant and will not of itself constitute a termination of this Lease by Landlord. Landlord's failure to relet the Demised Premises or to make such alterations, redecorations and repairs as set forth in this paragraph will not release or affect Tenant's liability for Rent or for damages;

(iii)enter upon the Demised Premises without being liable for prosecution or any claim of damages therefor, and do whatever Tenant is obligated to do under the terms of this Lease; and Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on demand for any actual expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees which Landlord may incur in thus effecting compliance with Tenant's obligations under this Lease. TENANT AGREES THAT LANDLORD SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING TO TENANT FROM SUCH ACTION AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ITS RELEASE OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER COVER AND RELATE TO, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY NEGLIGENT ACTION OR OMISSION OF LANDLORD OR THE LANDLORD PARTIES); or

(iv)without notice, alter the locks and any other security device or devices which allow Tenant access to the Demised Premises or the Building, and Landlord shall not be required to provide a new key or right of access to Tenant, and restrict or terminate any right to use parking facilities associated with the Building as well as Building services to the Demised Premises. This Article 17(b)(iv) is intended to and shall supersede the provisions of Section 93.002 of the Texas Property Code.

(c)If this Lease is terminated by Landlord as a result of the occurrence of an event of default, Landlord may declare to be due and payable immediately, the present value (calculated with a discount factor of eight percent [8%] per annum) of the difference between (x) the entire amount of Rent and other charges and assessments which in Landlord's reasonable determination would become due and payable during the remainder of the Lease Term determined as though this Lease had not been terminated (including, but not limited to, increases in Rent pursuant to Article l(g) hereof), and (y) the then fair market rental value of the Demised Premises for the remainder of the Lease Term. Upon the acceleration of such amounts, Tenant agrees to pay the same at once, together with all Rent and other charges and assessments theretofore due, at Landlord's address as provided herein, it being agreed that such payment does not constitute a penalty or forfeiture but constitutes liquidated damages for Tenant's failure to comply with the terms and provisions of this Lease (Landlord and Tenant agreeing that Landlord's actual damages in such event are impossible to ascertain and that the amount set forth above is a reasonable estimate thereof).

16



(d)Pursuit of any of the foregoing remedies will not preclude pursuit of any other remedy herein provided or any other remedy provided by law or at equity, nor will pursuit of any remedy herein provided constitute an election of remedies thereby excluding the later election of an alternate remedy, or a forfeiture or waiver of any Rent or other charges and assessments payable by Tenant and due to Landlord hereunder or of any damages accruing to Landlord by reason of violation of any of the terms, covenants, warranties and provisions herein contained. No reentry or taking possession of the Demised Premises by Landlord or any other action taken by or on behalf of Landlord should be construed to be an acceptance of a surrender of this Lease or an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention is given to Tenant. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon an event of default should not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such default. In determining the amount of loss or damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of termination of this Lease or the deficiency arising by reason of any reletting of the Demised Premises by Landlord as above provided, allowance will be made for the expense of repossession. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord all actual costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in the enforcement of this Lease.

(e)Upon the occurrence of any event of default by Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all actual costs incurred by Landlord (including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) in (i) obtaining possession of the Demised Premises, (ii) removing and storing Tenant's or any other occupant's property, (iii) repairing, restoring, renovating or otherwise putting the Demised Premises into condition acceptable to a new tenant, (iv) if Tenant is dispossessed of, or vacates or abandons, the Demised Premises and this Lease is not terminated, reletting all or any part of the Demised Premises (including, but not limited to, brokerage commissions, cost of tenant finish work, advertising and promotional expenses, and other costs incidental to such reletting), (v) performing Tenant's obligations which Tenant failed to perform, and (vi) enforcing its rights, remedies, and recourses arising out of the default. Landlord's rights and remedies under this Article 17(e) are in addition to the rights and remedies of Landlord set forth in this Article 17 or elsewhere in this Lease, and/or which may otherwise be available to Landlord at law or in equity.

(f)If Tenant does not pay any Rent when due hereunder, Tenant shall pay Landlord an administration fee in the amount of $250.00. In addition, past due Rent shall accrue interest at the lesser of 18% per annum or the highest lawful rate allowed under applicable law (the ""Default Rate""), and Tenant shall pay Landlord a reasonable fee for any checks returned by Tenant's bank for any reason.

17




18.Landlord's Lien. Landlord waives all contractual, statutory and constitutional liens held by Landlord on Tenant's personal property, goods, equipment, inventory, furnishings, chattels, accounts and assets to secure the obligations of Tenant under this Lease until such time as Landlord may obtain an enforceable judgment against Tenant from a court with jurisdiction of Tenant, at which time Landlord shall have such lien rights at law and in equity to enforce and collect such judgment and Tenant's obligations under this Lease.

19.Landlord's Liability. Landlord will have no personal liability with respect to any of the provisions of this Lease. If Landlord is in default with respect to its obligations under this Lease, Tenant will look solely to the equity of Landlord in and to the Building for satisfaction of Tenant's remedies, if any. It is expressly understood and agreed that Landlord's liability under the terms of this Lease will in no event exceed the amount of its interest in and to said Building. In no event will any partner of Landlord nor any member or joint venturer in Landlord, nor any officer, director or shareholder of Landlord or any such partner, member or joint venturer of Landlord be personally liable with respect to any of the provisions of this Lease. In no event shall Landlord, Cousins Properties LP, CPI Services LLC or Cousins Realty Services, LLC, or their directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees, or agents be liable
in any manner for incidental, consequential or punitive damages, loss of profits, or business interruption.

20.Waiver of Breach. No waiver of any breach of the covenants, warranties, agreements, provisions, or conditions contained in this Lease should be construed as a waiver of said covenant, warranty, provision, agreement or condition or of any subsequent breach thereof, and if any breach occurs and afterwards is compromised, settled or adjusted, this Lease will continue in full force and effect as if no breach had occurred.

21.Landlord's Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment. Provided no event of default exists beyond applicable notice and cure periods and subject to the terms and provisions hereof, Landlord covenants and agrees to take all necessary steps to secure and to maintain for the benefit of Tenant the quiet and peaceful possession of the Demised Premises, for the Lease Term, without hindrance, claim or molestation by Landlord or any other Person lawfully claiming under Landlord.

22.Intentionally deleted.

23.Holding Over. If Tenant remains in possession after expiration or termination of the Lease Term without Landlord's written consent, Tenant will become a tenant-at-sufferance, and there will be no renewal of this Lease by operation of law. During the period of any such holding over, all provisions of this Lease will be and remain in effect except that the monthly rental will be I 50% of the amount of Rent (including any adjustments as provided herein) payable for the last full calendar month of the Lease Term, including renewals or extensions. The inclusion of the preceding sentence in this Lease should not be construed as Landlord's consent for Tenant to hold over. Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for, and shall protect Landlord from and indemnify and defend Landlord against, all claims, including any claims made by any succeeding tenant resulting from such failure to vacate, and any all damages (including, without limitation, consequential damages) that Landlord suffers from the holding over.

24.Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornrnent: Estoppel Certificate. Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage(s), deed(s) of trust, ground lease(s) or other lien(s) now or subsequently affecting the Demised Premises, the Building or the Project, and to renewals, modifications, refinancings and extensions thereof (collectively, a ""Mortgage""). The party having the benefit of a Mortgage shall be referred to as a ""Mortgagee."" This clause shall be self-operative, but upon request from a Mortgagee, Tenant shall execute a commercially reasonable subordination and non-disturbance agreement in favor of the Mortgagee. In lieu of having the Mortgage be superior to this Lease, a Mortgagee shall have the right at any time to subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease. If requested by a successor-in-interest to all or a part of Landlord's interest in this Lease, Tenant shall, without charge, attorn to the successor-in-interest. Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request from Landlord, execute and deliver an estoppel certificate to those parties as are reasonably requested by Landlord (including a Mortgagee or prospective purchaser). The estoppel certificate shall include a
18



statement certifying that this Lease is unmodified (except as identified in the estoppel certificate) and in full force and effect, describing the dates to which Rent and other charges have been paid, representing that, to the best of Tenant's knowledge, there is no default (or stating with specificity the nature of the alleged default) and certifying other matters with respect to this Lease that may reasonably be requested. Tenant's failure to provide any estoppel certificate within the ten (10) day period specified above, and the continuation of such failure for a period of five (5) days after Landlord delivers a second written notice requesting same, shall constitute an event of default under this Lease.

Upon Tenant's written request, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure from the Mortgagee under any Mortgage now or hereafter encumbering the Demised Premises a non-disturbance agreement (""SNDA"") on the standard form of the Landlord's Mortgagee with or for the benefit of Tenant whereby the Landlord's Mortgagee agrees not to disturb Tenant's possession of the Demised Premises provided Tenant is not in default beyond applicable notice and cure periods; provided, however, Landlord shall have no liability if Landlord's Mortgagee does not agree to provide an SNDA notwithstanding Landlord's commercially reasonable efforts to secure the same. Tenant shall be responsible for any charges, fees or costs assessed by any Landlord's Mortgagee in providing an SNDA. ""Commercially reasonable efforts"" of Landlord shall not require Landlord to incur any cost, expense or liability to obtain an SNDA.

25.Attorneys' Fees. If either party institutes a suit against the other for violation of or to enforce any covenant or condition of this Lease, or if either party intervenes in any suit in which the other is a party to enforce or protect its interest in or rights under this Lease, then the Prevailing Party shall be entitled to all of its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The term ""Prevailing Party"" means the party, either Landlord or Tenant, that establishes a breach of this Lease by the other party or otherwise establishes liability of the other party for wrongful conduct, regardless of whether actual damages are awarded. In the case where both parties prevail on different claims, the Prevailing Party shall be the party that is awarded the greater amount of damages.

26.Notices. If a demand, request, approval, consent or notice (collectively, a ""notice"") shall or may be given to either party by the other, the notice shall be in writing and delivered by hand or sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, or sent by overnight or same day courier service, at the party's respective Notice Address(es) set forth in Article 1, except that if Tenant has vacated the Demised Premises (or if the Notice Address for Tenant is other than the Demised Premises, and Tenant has vacated such address) without providing Landlord a new Notice Address, Landlord may serve notice in any manner described in this Article or in any other manner permitted by Law. Each notice shall be deemed to have been received or given on the earlier to occur of actual delivery or the date on which delivery is first refused, or, if Tenant has vacated the Demised Premises or the other Notice Address of Tenant without providing a new Notice Address, three (3) days after notice is deposited in the U.S. mail or with a courier service in the manner described above. Either party may, at any time, change its Notice Address by giving the other party written notice of the new address in the manner described in this Article.

19




27.Surrender of Demised Premises. Upon the expiration or other termination of this Lease, Tenant shall quit and surrender to Landlord the Demised Premises and every part thereof and all alterations, additions and improvements thereto, broom clean and in good condition and state of repair, reasonable wear and tear only excepted. If Tenant is not then in default, Tenant shall remove all personalty and equipment not attached to the Demised Premises which it has placed upon the Demised Premises, and Tenant shall restore the Demised Premises to the condition immediately preceding the time of placement thereof. Tenant will not be responsible for removing wires and cables installed by Tenant in the Demised Premises and other portions of the Building to serve Tenant's telecommunications and computer systems in the Demised Premises (""Cabling"") provided the same are properly mapped and tagged by Tenant, including identification of each data junction box and the centrally located patch panel. Tenant will be responsible for removing all other Cabling, and the removal of such Cabling will be effected by Tenant without damage to the Building and without interference with the business or operations of Landlord or any other tenant of the Building. If Tenant fails or refuses to remove all of Tenant's effects, personalty and equipment from the Demised Premises and the Building upon the expiration or termination of this Lease for any cause whatsoever or upon the Tenant being dispossessed by process of law or otherwise, such effects, personalty and equipment will be deemed conclusively to be abandoned and may be appropriated, sold, stored, destroyed or otherwise disposed of by Landlord without written notice to Tenant or any other party and without obligation to account for them. Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand any and all expenses incurred by Landlord in the removal of such property, including, without limitation, the cost of repairing any damage to the Building or Project caused by the removal of such property and storage charges (if Landlord elects to store such property). The covenants and conditions of this Article 27 will survive any expiration or termination of this Lease.

28.Hazardous Substances. Tenant hereby covenants and agrees that Tenant will not cause or permit any ""Hazardous Substances"" (as hereinafter defined) to be generated, placed, held, stored, used, located or disposed of at the Project or any part thereof, except for Hazardous Substances as are commonly and legally used or stored as a consequence of using the Demised Premises for general office and administrative purposes, but only so long as the quantities thereof do not pose a threat to public health or to the environment or would necessitate a ""response action"", as that term is defined in CERCLA (as hereinafter defined), and so long as Tenant strictly complies or causes compliance with all applicable governmental rules and regulations concerning the use, storage, production, transportation and disposal of such Hazardous Substances. Promptly upon receipt of Landlord1s request, Tenant shall submit to Landlord true and correct copies of any reports filed by Tenant with any governmental or quasi-governmental authority regarding the generation, placement, storage, use, treatment or disposal of Hazardous Substances on or about the Demised Premises. Tenant also agrees to cooperate with Landlord and to provide access by Landlord and Landlord's representatives to any Tenant's records with respect to the Demised Premises relating to any assessment of the environmental condition of the Demised Premises and the generation, placement, storage, use, treatment or disposal of Hazardous Substances on or about the Demised Premises. For purposes of this Article 28, “Hazardous Substances"" means and includes those elements or compounds which are contained in the list of Hazardous Substances adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or in any list of toxic pollutants designated by Congress or the EPA or which are defined as hazardous, toxic, pollutant, infectious or radioactive by any other federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, code, rule, regulation, order or decree regulating, relating to or imposing liability (including, without limitation, strict liability) or standards of conduct concerning, any hazardous, toxic or dangerous waste, substance or material, as now or at any time hereinafter in effect (collectively ""Environmental Laws""). Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify Landlord and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, including strict liability, damages, injuries, expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, costs of settlement or judgment and claims of any and every kind whatsoever paid, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against, Landlord by any Person for, with respect to, or as a direct or indirect result of, the presence in, or the escape, leakage, spillage, discharge, emission or release from, the Demised Premises of any Hazardous Substances (including, without limitation, any losses, liabilities, including strict liability, damages, injuries, expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, costs of any settlement or judgment or claims asserted or arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act [""CERCLA""], any so called federal, state or local ""Superfund"" or “Superlien” laws or any other Environmental Law); provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity is limited to matters arising solely from Tenant's
20



violation of the covenant contained in this Article. The obligations of Tenant under this Article will survive any expiration or termination of this Lease.

29.Miscellaneous.

(a)Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue: Severability: Paragraph Headings. This Lease and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State in which the Project is located. All obligations under this Lease are performable in the county or other jurisdiction where the Project is located, which shall be venue for all legal actions. If any term or provision of this Lease shall be invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be automatically reformed to the extent necessary to render such term or provision enforceable, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. The remainder of this Lease shall not be affected, and each remaining and reformed provision of this Lease shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. The headings and titles to the Articles and Sections of this Lease are for convenience only and shall have no effect on the interpretation of any part of this Lease. The words ""include"", ""including'' and similar words will not be construed restrictively to limit or exclude other items not listed.

(b)Cumulative Rights. All rights, powers and privileges conferred hereunder upon the parties hereto are cumulative to, but not restrictive of, or in lieu of those conferred by law.

(c)Recording. Tenant shall not record this Lease or any memorandum without Landlord's prior written consent.

(d)Force Majeure. Whenever a period of time is prescribed for the taking of an action by Landlord or Tenant, the period of time for the performance of such action shall be extended by the number of days that the performance is actually delayed due to strikes, acts of God, shortages of labor or materials, war, terrorist attacks (including bio-chemical attacks), civil disturbances and other causes beyond the reasonable control of the performing party (''force majeure""). However, events of force majeure shall not extend any period of time for the payment of Rent or other sums payable by either party or any period of time for the written exercise of an option or right by either party.

(e)Transferability: Release of Landlord. Landlord shall have the right to transfer and assign, in whole or in part, all of its rights and obligations under this Lease and in the Building and/or Project, and upon such transfer Landlord shall be released from any further obligations hereunder, and Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of Landlord for the performance of such obligations.

(f)Brokers. Tenant represents that it has dealt directly with and only with Colliers International (whose commission shall be paid by Landlord pursuant to a separate written agreement) in connection with this Lease. TENANT AND LANDLORD SHALL EACH INDEMNIFY THE OTHER AGAINST ALL COSTS, EXPENSES, ATTORNEYS' FEES, LIENS AND OTHER LIABILITY' FOR COMMISSIONS OR OTHER COMPENSATION CLAIMED BY ANY BROKER OR AGENT CLAIMING THE SAME BY, THROUGH OR UNDER THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY OTHER THAN THE BROKER(S) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ABOVE.

(g)Authority; Joint and Several Liability. Landlord covenants, warrants and represents that each individual executing, attesting and/or delivering this Lease on behalf of Landlord is authorized to do so on behalf of Landlord, this Lease is binding upon and enforceable against Landlord, and Landlord is duly organized and legally existing in the state of its organization and is qualified to do business in the state in which the Premises are located. Similarly, Tenant covenants, warrants and represents that each individual executing, attesting and/or delivering this Lease on behalf of Tenant is authorized to do so on behalf of Tenant, this Lease is binding upon and enforceable against Tenant; and Tenant is duly organized
21



and legally existing in the state of its organization and is qualified to do business in the state in which the Premises are located. If there is more than one Tenant, or if Tenant is comprised of more than one party or entity, the obligations imposed upon Tenant shall be joint and several obligations of all the parties and entities. Notices, payments and agreements given or made by, with or to any one person or entity shall be deemed to have been given or made by, with and to all of them.

(h)Time is of the Essence: Relationship: No Estate: Successors and Assigns. Time is of the essence with respect to Tenant's performance of its obligations and the exercise of any refusal, offer, expansion, renewal or extension rights or other options granted to Tenant. This Lease shall create only the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties, and not a partnership, joint venture or any other relationship. This Lease creates the relationship of landlord and tenant only between Landlord and Tenant and no estate will pass out of Landlord. Tenant has only a usufruct, not subject to levy and sale and not assignable in whole or in part by Tenant except as herein provided. This Lease and the covenants and conditions in this Lease shall inure only to the benefit of and be binding only upon Landlord and Tenant and their permitted successors and assigns.

(i)Survival of Obligations. The expiration of the Term, whether by lapse of time or otherwise, shall not relieve either party of any obligations which accrued prior to or which may continue to accrue after the expiration or early termination of this Lease.

(j)Binding Effect. Landlord has delivered a copy of this Lease to Tenant for Tenant's review only, and the delivery of it does not constitute an offer to Tenant or an option. This Lease shall not be effective against any party hereto until an original copy of this Lease has been signed by such party and delivered to the other party and, if required, upon approval by Landlord's Mortgagee.

(k)Full Agreement: Amendments. This Lease contains the parties' entire agreement regarding the subject matter hereof. All understandings, discussions, and agreements previously made between the parties, written or oral, are superseded by this Lease, and neither party is relying upon any warranty, statement or representation not contained in this Lease. This Lease may be modified only by a written agreement signed by Landlord and Tenant. The exhibits, schedules and riders attached hereto are incorporated herein and made a part of this Lease for all purposes.

(l)Financial Statements.

Each party also represents and warrants to the other that neither such party nor its constituents or Affiliates are in violation of any laws relating to terrorism or money laundering, including the aforesaid Executive Order and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-56), as amended. Each party hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, risks, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable

(n)Texas Tax Code Provisions. Tenant hereby waives any right it may have under Section 41.413 of the Texas Tax Code to protest (and Tenant hereby agrees that it shall not protest) the appraised value of all or any portion of the Demised Premises, the Building or the Project, and Tenant further waives any right it may have under Section 42.015 of the Texas Tax Code to appeal an order of the appraisal review board with respect to all or any portion of the Demised Premises, the Building and/or the Project. Tenant agrees that Landlord shall have the sole right to protest any appraisals of the Demised Premises, the Building and the Project.

Tenant agrees that Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any damages for Landlord's failure to send to Tenant a copy of any notice of reappraisal concerning the Demised Premises, the Building and/or the Project, irrespective of any obligation under applicable laws of Landlord to provide such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant protests, challenges or appeals any valuation for property tax purposes of all or any portion of the Demised Premises, the Building and/or the Project, and such valuation increases from the value protested, appealed or challenged, Tenant agrees to indemnify Landlord on an after-tax basis for any property taxes due as a result of such increase and for all other costs and expenses incurred by Landlord as a result thereby.

(p)Confidentiality. Tenant acknowledges that the terms and conditions of this Lease are to remain confidential for Landlord's benefit, and may not be disclosed by Tenant to anyone, by any manner or means, directly or indirectly, without Landlord's prior written consent; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to Tenant's representatives who need to know such information for the purposes of fulfilling the obligations under this Lease and utilizing the Demised Premises (it being understood that such representatives shall be informed of (i) the confidential nature of such information and (ii) the obligation of confidentiality undertaken under this Lease, and shall be directed to treat such information confidentially). The consent by Landlord to any disclosures shall not be deemed to be a waiver on the part of Landlord of any prohibition against any future disclosure. Tenant agrees to be responsible for any breach of this section by any third party to whom Tenant has provided confidential information, or any portion thereof. If Tenant or any third party to whom Tenant has provided information regarding the terms and conditions of this Lease becomes legally compelled (by oral question, deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or by rule, regulation or other applicable law) to disclose any information, Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord of such requirement before any disclosure is made so that Landlord (at its own expense) may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or may waive compliance with the terms of this section. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if Landlord waives compliance with the provisions of this section, Tenant agrees that only that portion of the information regarding the terms and conditions of this Lease which it is legally required to disclose (as advised by a written opinion of counsel) will be disclosed, and Tenant agrees to exercise its best efforts to obtain assurance that the information will be treated confidentially upon disclosure. Landlord and Tenant agree that disclosure of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease could irreparably injure Landlord and Landlord's relationships with other tenants in the Building, and Landlord shall be entitled to equitable relief
23



in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this section. Such remedies shall not be exclusive. The provisions of this section shall survive any expiration or termination of this Lease.

In addition to such indemnities as may be provided for in the Master Lease, Subtenant
agrees to indemnify and hold Sublandlord and its affiliates, officers, agents, servants, employees and
independent contractors (individually a “Sublandlord Party” and collectively, “Sublandlord Parties”)
harmless against all loss, damage, liability, or expense suffered or claimed against any Sublandlord
Party, by any person or entity (i) caused by or otherwise arising from, in whole or in part, any breach
or default by Subtenant of any covenant or obligation it has hereunder (including but not limited to all
covenants or obligations of the tenant under the Master Lease assumed by Subtenant pursuant to the
terms of this Sublease), or (ii) caused by or in connection with anything owned or controlled by 
Subtenant, or (iii) resulting from any act, failure to act, or negligence of Subtenant or its employees,
agents or invitees, or (iv) resulting from any nuisance suffered on the Subleased Premises, except for
damage or injury to third parties or property resulting from the proven gross negligence of
Sublandlord, Landlord or their respective employees, agents, representatives, successors or assigns.
Subtenant further agrees to indemnify Sublandlord and hold Sublandlord harmless from all losses,
damages, liabilities and expenses which Sublandlord may incur, or for which Sublandlord may be
liable to Master Landlord, arising from the acts or omissions of Subtenant which are or are alleged to
be defaults of Sublandlord under the Master Lease or are the subject matter of any indemnity or hold
harmless of Sublandlord, as tenant, to Master Landlord under the Master Lease. The obligations of
Subtenant to indemnify Sublandlord and/or the Sublandlord Parties and/or hold the Sublandlord and/or
the Sublandlord Parties harmless in this Section 12 and elsewhere herein shall survive the expiration or
other termination of this Sublease.
13. Master Lease.
13.1 Master Lease. Notwithstanding anything in this Sublease to the contrary, the
rights of Subtenant shall be subject to and limited by the terms and conditions contained in the Master
Lease between Sublandlord and Master Landlord as applicable to tenant thereunder, as they may be
amended from time to time. Sublandlord shall have the right to amend the Master Lease from time to
time without the consent of Subtenant provided that any such amendment shall not adversely affect
Subtenant’s ability to continue its then current operations in the Subleased Premises, increase any of
the rental or other payments required to be made by Subtenant hereunder or otherwise materially and
adversely change Subtenant’s rights and obligations hereunder. Sublandlord shall endeavor to give
Subtenant notice of any amendment to the Master Lease, but the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such amendment or its applicability to Subtenant, except that Subtenant shall have
no obligation to comply with the terms of any such amendment until it has received a copy. Any rights
granted to Subtenant herein which are limited by the Master Lease shall be deemed to be so limited by
this Sublease.
13.2 No Violation. Notwithstanding anything in this Sublease to the contrary,
Subtenant shall not commit or permit to be committed any act or omission which shall violate any term
or condition of the Master Lease. Subtenant shall indemnify and hold harmless Sublandlord from and
against any loss, liability, claim, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by
Sublandlord as a result of any termination or attempted termination by Sublandlord or Master Landlord
of the Master Lease resulting from any such act or omission by Subtenant.
13.3 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]
13.4 Termination of Master Lease. If the Master Lease terminates for any reason
prior to the expiration or other termination of this Sublease, this Sublease shall terminate concurrently
therewith without any liability of Sublandlord to Subtenant and, except for any Subtenant obligations
hereunder arising on or prior to the termination of this Sublease, following Subtenant’s surrender in
compliance with Section 4.2 hereof, Subtenant’s obligations hereunder shall terminate, except with
respect to any indemnification or hold harmless obligations of Subtenant, which shall survive such
termination.
13.5 Incorporation of Master Lease. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Sublease to the contrary, this Sublease and Subtenant's rights under this Sublease shall at all times be

observe and perform or cause to be kept, observed and performed, faithfully all those terms, covenants
and conditions of Sublandlord as tenant under the Master Lease with respect to the Subleased

Master Lease are incorporated herein by reference, and Sublandlord shall have the rights and
responsibilities with respect to the Subtenant that the Master Landlord has with respect to Sublandlord
pursuant to the Master Lease, and Subtenant shall have the rights and responsibilities with respect to
Sublandlord that Sublandlord has with respect to the Master Landlord pursuant to the Master Lease.
However, to the extent that the Master Lease requires or obligates Master Landlord to maintain, repair,
restore, or otherwise expend any money or take any action to preserve and maintain all or any portion
of the Subleased Premises or to furnish any services to the Subleased Premises, such obligation shall
not pass to Sublandlord by reason of this Sublease and shall remain with the Master Landlord. Subject
to the first sentence of this Section 13.5, with respect to the relationship between the Sublandlord and
the Subtenant, the terms, covenants and conditions of this Sublease shall control with respect to any
conflict or inconsistency between the terms, covenants and conditions contained herein and the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Master Lease.

and shall continue to tender payment of the Security Deposit as set forth in Section 3.03. of the Master
Lease. Upon expiration of the Master Lease, Sublandlord shall forward payment to Subtenant within
thirty (30) days of receipt from Masterlandlord any refunded Security Deposit amounts it has received
pursuant to Section 3.03. of the Master Lease.

Sublease and Subtenant shall hold Sublandlord harmless from any and all liability, loss, damage,
expense, claim action, demand, suit or obligation arising out of or relating to a breach by Subtenant of
such representation.

18. Waivers; Amendments.
No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
law. Any provision of this Sublease may be waived if, but only if, such waiver is in writing and is
signed by the party against whom the enforcement of such waiver is sought. No waiver of any
provision of this Sublease, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or construed as, a
further or continuing waiver of any such provision. This Sublease may not be amended, modified or
supplemented other than by a written instrument signed by each party hereto.
19. Entire Agreement.
This Sublease constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the parties
hereto and supercedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, relating to the
subject matter hereof.

Sublease or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Sublease in
any other jurisdictions, it being intended that all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Subtenant covenants and agrees that (a) during the Term (as hereinafter defined) of this Sublease, Subtenant will perform and observe all of the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements of the Master Lease to be performed by Sublandlord (including, without limitation, the providing of estoppel certificates and subordination agreements in accordance with the Master Lease, if applicable) to the extent that the same are not modified or amended by this Sublease, (b) Subtenant shall not do, suffer or permit anything to be done which would constitute a default under the Master Lease or might cause the Master Lease to be canceled, terminated or forfeited, and (c) Subtenant will, in accordance with Section 9 below, and subject to the limitations therein, indemnify and hold harmless Sublandlord and Master Landlord from and against all claims, liabilities, losses and damages of any kind that Sublandlord or Master Landlord may incur to the extent they are by reason of, resulting from or arising out of a failure by Subtenant to comply with the provisions of this Sublease and/or the Master Lease, including, without limitation, subsections (a) and (b) of this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subtenant shall have no obligation to cure any default of Sublandlord under the Master Lease (except to the extent such default is caused by Subtenant’s default hereunder).

4.2 Utilization of Master Lease Provisions as Part of Sublease.

 

(a) Except as the terms and conditions set forth in this Sublease modify or contradict the terms and conditions of the Master Lease or any exhibits or attachments thereto, all of the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease are hereby made a part of this Sublease and are deemed to constitute a portion of the agreement between Sublandlord and Subtenant concerning the leasing of the Subleased Premises; provided, however, that to the extent any of the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are inappropriate or inapplicable to this Sublease, such terms and provisions shall not be made a part hereof and in the event of any inconsistency between the Master Lease and this Sublease, as between Sublandlord and Subtenant, the provisions of this Sublease shall take precedence over any conflicting provisions of the Master Lease. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that the following provisions of the Master Lease shall not be applicable to this Sublease: Sections 1.2 (except with respect to Master Landlord’s address), 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 7.2.E., 7.2.H., Article 3, Sections 9.2, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 11.2, 12.1, 15.7 (except with respect to providing notice to Master Landlord), 15.11, Paragraphs 1, 2, 12 and 15 of the Lease Rider and Exhibits B and E. Where references are made in the Master Lease to the “Premises”, the same shall be deemed to refer to the Subleased Premises hereunder; where references are made in the Master Lease to the “Commencement Date,” the same shall be deemed to refer to the Commencement Date hereunder; where references are made to the Master Lease to “Base Monthly Rent”, the same shall be deemed to refer to Monthly Base Rent hereunder; where references are made under the Master Lease to “Additional Rent”, the same shall be deemed to refer to Additional Rent hereunder; and where references are made in the Master Lease to “this Lease” the same shall be deemed to refer to this Sublease.

 

(b) It is understood by Subtenant that the services, repairs and alterations referred to herein to be furnished in accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease will in fact be furnished by Master Landlord and not by Sublandlord. Sublandlord shall not be liable to Subtenant nor shall Subtenant’s obligations hereunder be impaired or the performance thereof excused because of any failure or delay on Master Landlord’s part in furnishing any such service or in making any of such repairs or alterations unless and to the extent that Sublandlord reasonably agrees that Sublandlord’s performance of such obligations is excused pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any default by Master Landlord results in a waiver or deferral of the performance of any of Sublandlord’s obligations under the Master Lease, the same obligations of Subtenant hereunder shall be similarly waived or deferred, as applicable, but all other obligations of Subtenant shall remain in full force and effect. Sublandlord agrees that if Master Landlord fails to provide any thing or service which Master Landlord is required to provide pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease, or otherwise defaults thereunder, Sublandlord will, upon the written request of Subtenant and at Subtenant’s cost and expense (except to the extent that such costs and expenses are reimbursed by Master Landlord to Sublandlord), provide such assistance as Subtenant may reasonably request, including without limitation, making a claim and/or demand on Master Landlord in the name of Sublandlord, to effect a cure of such default by Master Landlord or otherwise. Likewise, if Sublandlord defaults under the Master Lease, Subtenant shall have the

right (subject to any applicable notice and cure provisions in the Master Lease and in this Sublease and subject to the consent of Master Landlord being first had and obtained), but not the obligation, to cure any such default, on behalf of Sublandlord and at Sublandlord’s cost and expense, including, without limitation, offsetting any costs and expenses incurred by Subtenant against Monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent payable hereunder (provided that Subtenant may not exercise the foregoing right of offset if Sublandlord has notified Subtenant that Sublandlord is disputing such alleged default in good faith and Master Landlord has not availed itself of any of its remedies under the Master Lease which would impair the continued existence of this Sublease). It is further understood by Subtenant that its rights with respect to the repair and restoration of the Subleased Premises or the Building, its rights as to the use and application of insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds, its rights to rent abatement and its right to terminate this Sublease in the event of damage to or condemnation of all or any part of the Subleased Premises or the Building are all subject to the prior rights, if any, of Master Landlord. All expenses incurred by Master Landlord in connection with the Landlord Consent (as defined herein) shall be paid one-half by each party hereto.

 

(c) It is further understood by Subtenant that Sublandlord will not be obligated to comply with Master Landlord’s responsibilities pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Master Lease relating to “Compliance with Law”, and Section 11.1 relating to “Landlord’s Duty to Restore” and Paragraph 16 of the Lease Rider relating to “Adjacent Property Rights.” In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, only Master Landlord exclusively, not Sublandlord, shall have the rights of “Landlord” pursuant to the following provisions of the Master Lease as incorporated herein: Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2 (provided, however, such alterations and improvements shall not materially impair Sublandlord’s Point of Presence and conduits pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3 hereof, and Subtenant shall provide notice to Sublandlord in each case in which notice is provided to Master Landlord pursuant to Section 5.2 of the Master Lease), 6.3, 7.2(D), 7.2(G), Article 8, 11.2, 11.3, 12.1 and 12.5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Sublease, the parties agree and acknowledge that any right to terminate the leasehold interest by Subtenant shall only be with respect to the Sublease and not the Master Lease, and Sublandlord shall retain the retain the right to terminate the Master Lease pursuant to the terms thereof. Any attempt by Subtenant to terminate the Master Lease shall be null and void.

 

4.3 Master Lease in Full Force and Effect. Sublandlord represents, covenants and agrees that: (i) a true, correct and complete copy of the Master Lease is attached hereto as Exhibit B and there exist no other agreements between Master Landlord and Sublandlord governing the use or occupancy of the Subleased Premises; (ii) the Master Lease is in full force and effect and has not been amended, supplemented or otherwise changed; (iii) to the best of Sublandlord’s knowledge, Sublandlord is not in default under the Master Lease (and no set of circumstances exists which, with the passage of time or giving of notice, would constitute a default thereunder); (iv) Sublandlord has paid and performed all obligations required to be paid or performed by Sublandlord under the Master Lease through the date the Sublease term commences; (v) Sublandlord has no knowledge of any default by Master Landlord under the Master Lease; (vi) the term of the Master Lease expires on September 30, 2014; and (vii) and the provisions of the Master Lease will not be waived, modified, amended or surrendered by Sublandlord in any manner so as to prevent or adversely affect the use by Subtenant of the Subleased Premises in accordance with the terms of this Sublease, nor as to impose any greater

obligations on Subtenant than are imposed on Subtenant under this Sublease, or provide to Subtenant any lesser rights than are provided to Subtenant under this Sublease, without the prior written consent of Subtenant in each instance.

 

5. Effectiveness of Sublease. This Sublease shall be effective on the Closing Date except for the following provisions of this Sublease, which shall become effective as of the date of this Sublease: Sections 3, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. The parties hereto acknowledge that one of the conditions to the closing is that Master Landlord must provide its written consent to this Sublease pursuant to the Landlord Consent. Sublandlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of Master Landlord.

7.1 Rent. Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord as “Monthly Base Rent” the following amounts: (i) during the first two (2) years of the Term, an amount equal to [*] payable by Sublandlord under the Master Lease; and (ii) thereafter, for the remainder of the Term, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord, [*] payable by Sublandlord under the Master Lease. Notwithstanding the immediately previous sentence or anything to the contrary contained herein, (x) if a Subtenant Default occurs during the first 2-years of the Term, the Monthly Base Rent payable by Subtenant shall increase to [*]; and (y) if a Subtenant Default occurs after the initial two years of the Term, Subtenant shall, within thirty (30) days of Sublandlord’s written demand, pay to Sublandlord an amount equal to [*] multiplied by the number of days elapsed from the Commencement Date until the date on which Subtenant’s Default occurred, but not to exceed a total of [*], as well as all unpaid and accrued rental amounts. The foregoing sentence shall not limit and the Sublandlord shall have available to it all other non-monetary remedies available to it pursuant to Section 13.2 of the Master Lease. As used herein, “Subtenant Default” shall mean a default by Subtenant hereunder that continues beyond any applicable grace, notice and cure periods. Subtenant agrees to commence paying an amount equal to [*] in advance for the first month of the Term on the Commencement Date and to make rent payments thereafter on the first day of each month during the remaining Term of this Sublease. All rental amounts hereunder for any partial month will be prorated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed. Except as expressly permitted in this Sublease, all rental amounts hereunder shall be payable to Sublandlord without notice, demand, deduction, offset or abatement in lawful money of the United States of America at P.O. Box 219061, Kansas City, MO 64121-9061 or to such other person or at such other address as Sublandlord may designate in writing. If any Monthly Base Rent or Additional Rent is not received by Sublandlord from Subtenant within five (5) days of the later of (i) when due or (ii) after written notice to Subtenant that the same has not been received by Sublandlord (provided such notice for late payment has not previously been given in the preceding twelve months), then Subtenant shall immediately pay to Sublandlord a late charge equal to the lesser of any penalties, default interest charges or other similar costs computed based on the delinquent amount actually incurred by Sublandlord under the Master Lease by reason of Subtenant’s late payment or [*] percent ([*]%) of such delinquent rent, as liquidated damages for Subtenant’s failure to make timely payment. If any rent remains delinquent for a period in excess of thirty (30) days then, in addition to such late charge, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord interest on any rent that is not paid when due at the Agreed Interest Rate following the date such amount became due until paid. This paragraph shall not be deemed to grant Subtenant an extension of time within which to pay rent or prevent Sublandlord from exercising any other right or remedy.

 

7.2 Other Charges. Subtenant shall pay all sales and uses taxes levied or assessed against all rent payments due under this Sublease (if any) simultaneously with each payment required hereunder.

*	 	CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
amounts payable under Sections 3.2 and 8.1 of the Master Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Sublease, Subtenant shall not be responsible for any charges, costs, expenses or similar items (“Charges”) deemed to be Additional Rent if and to the extent said Charges are incurred as a result of Sublandlord in its role as Tenant under Master Lease breaching its representations, warranties and covenants thereunder (including, without limitation, damages claimed by Master Landlord, indemnification obligations owed to Master Landlord, enforcement fees owed to Master Landlord and costs of discharging mechanic’s liens arising through Sublandlord) which have not been assumed by Subtenant hereunder. In addition, Additional Rent shall not include premiums for insurance policies required to be maintained by Sublandlord (in its capacity as tenant under the Master Lease) pursuant to the Master Lease, and Excess rent required to be paid by Sublandlord pursuant to Article 14 of the Master Lease. Subtenant agrees to pay any and all such Additional Rent in estimated equal monthly installments or as may otherwise be required under the terms of the Master Lease. During the Term, Master Landlord may be permitted to adjust the amounts of such installments payable under the Master Lease. In such event, Sublandlord may adjust the amount of the installments due hereunder and, at the end of each calendar year during the Term, an adjustment will be made to compensate for any overage or shortfall with respect to the monthly estimated installments paid versus the actual real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance costs, management fees and the like owed, as and when provided in the Master Lease. To the extent Master Landlord has not agreed to do so pursuant to the Landlord’s Consent, Sublandlord shall promptly forward to Subtenant any statements received from Master Landlord relating to the payment of Common Operating Expenses and annual reconciliations thereof.

 

If Subtenant so requests, Sublandlord shall, at no cost or expense to Sublandlord, exercise the right to contest Real Property Taxes pursuant to Section 8.3 of the Master Lease. If Subtenant so requests, Sublandlord shall cause an audit of Master Landlord’s books and records as permitted and in the manner provided for under Section 8.1 of the Master Lease. Any and all costs incurred by Sublandlord shall be borne by Subtenant and shall be considered Additional Rent. To the extent Master Landlord is not ultimately required to bear the costs of such audit in accordance with the Master Lease, the costs of such audit shall be borne by Subtenant, but in no event shall be Sublandlord be liable for such costs. Regardless of whether Subtenant elects to cause an audit of Master Landlord’s books and records, if Sublandlord’s payments toward Common Operating Expenses exceed the total payments made by Subtenant, Subtenant shall pay Sublandlord the deficiency within thirty (30) days of the date of Sublandlord’s statement. If the total payments by Subtenant, as determined pursuant to the audit, exceed the total actual amount of Additional Rent owed by Subtenant, Subtenant’s excess payment shall be refunded to Subtenant within thirty (30) days of the date of Sublandlord’s statement, and if not refunded within thirty (30) days, may be offset by Subtenant against the next installment of Monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent payable hereunder. For any partial calendar year at the commencement or termination of this Sublease, Subtenant’s Additional Rent for such year shall be prorated for the number of days this Sublease is in effect during such year. Notwithstanding the termination of this Sublease, within thirty (30) business days after Subtenant’s receipt of Sublandlord’s statement regarding Additional Rent in the calendar year in which this Sublease terminates, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord or shall receive from Sublandlord, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between the actual amount of Additional Rent (as prorated) and the amount previously paid by Subtenant toward Additional Rent.

7.3 Survival. Subtenant’s obligation to pay all rental amounts hereunder and to remove alterations and improvements (except as provided in Section 4.2(ii) hereof), as well as any other obligation of Subtenant hereunder which is not fully satisfied at the termination of this Sublease, will survive the termination of this Sublease. Sublandlord’s obligation to refund to Subtenant any overpayments of Additional Rent shall also survive the termination of this Sublease.

 

8. Use. The Subleased Premises may be used and occupied during the Term of this Sublease only for those purposes for which the Premises may be used and occupied by Sublandlord pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease. Subtenant must, at Subtenant’s expense, comply promptly with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, restrictions of record and requirements in effect during the Term or any part of the Term hereof regulating the use by Subtenant of the Subleased Premises.

 

9. Indemnity. Subtenant hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Sublandlord and Master Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or losses incurred by Sublandlord or Master Landlord arising out of any breach by Subtenant of any of the terms of, or its representations contained in, this Sublease, for bodily injury to or death of any person or damage to any property arising out of Subtenant’s use of the Subleased Premises or from the conduct of Subtenant’s business, or from any activity, work or thing done, permitted or suffered by Subtenant in or about the Subleased Premises or the Building, except:

(c) claims and liabilities occasioned in whole or in part by the grossly negligent acts or omissions of the indemnified party, its agents or employees; and

 

(d) claims or liabilities for property damage addressed in Paragraph 10 of this Sublease entitled “Mutual Waiver of Claims”.

The foregoing indemnities include all reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim or any action or proceeding brought thereon.

 

10. Mutual Waiver of Claims. Sublandlord and Subtenant do each hereby release and relieve the other and Master Landlord, and waive their entire claim of recovery against the other party and/or Master Landlord for loss or damage to property arising out of or incident to fire, lightning or any other perils normally included in an “all-risks” property insurance policy when such property constitutes the Subleased Premises or the Building or is in, on or about the Subleased Premises, the Building or the land on which the Building is situated, whether or not such loss or damage is due to the negligence of Sublandlord, Subtenant or Master Landlord, their agents, employees, guests, licensees, invitees or contractors, to the extent such loss or damage is covered by such insurance.

 

11. Default. The notice and grace period provisions contained in the Master Lease shall apply to any default by Subtenant hereunder. If Subtenant defaults in the payment of any rental amounts hereunder or any other sum required to be paid hereunder by Subtenant, or in the performance of any of its other obligations under this Sublease or the Master Lease beyond any applicable notice or grace period Sublandlord shall have the same rights and remedies against Subtenant as Master Landlord has against Sublandlord in the event of Sublandlord’s default under the Master Lease; provided, however, that any damages recoverable by Sublandlord shall be computed based on the Monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent payable under this Sublease Such rights and remedies shall be cumulative with all other rights and remedies which Sublandlord may otherwise have under applicable law.

 

12. Transfer of Subleased Premises.

Any consent to subletting or assignment which may be given by Sublandlord shall not constitute a waiver by Sublandlord of the provisions of this Section 12, or a release of Subtenant from the full performance by it of the covenants on the part of Subtenant herein contained. Any violation of any provision of this Sublease by any subtenant shall be deemed a violation of such provision by Subtenant.

If Subtenant fails to respond to such written request by Sublandlord to Subtenant within ten (10) days, then consent will be deemed to have been given. If the Master Lease imposes on Master Landlord, the obligation to repair or restore leasehold improvements or alterations, Subtenant shall permit Master Landlord to enter the Subleased Premises to perform the same. Subtenant shall have the right to terminate the Sublease as a result of a casualty or condemnation to the extent Sublandlord has the right to
