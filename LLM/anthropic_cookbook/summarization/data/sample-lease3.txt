(b) Operating Costs and Additional Rent.

(i) In addition to the Base Rent payable pursuant to Section 4.a above, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord (1) from and after January 1, 2013, for each calendar year of the Term, Subtenant’s Percentage Share (as defined below) of the amount by which Operating Costs (as defined in the Lease) payable by Sublandlord for the Premises for the then current calendar year exceeds the Base Operating Costs (as defined below) (such amount, “Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs”), and (2) an amount equal to all Additional Rent (as defined in the Lease) attributable to the Subleased Premises during the Term of this Sublease; provided, however, Subtenant shall not be responsible for, and shall have no obligation to pay Additional Rent incurred in connection with (i) the negligent acts or omissions of Sublandlord under Section 18.2 of the Lease, or any other acts or omissions of Sublandlord for which, but for this Sublease, Sublandlord would be responsible under the Master Lease, (ii) a Transfer (as defined in the Lease) by Sublandlord under Article 8 of the Lease, and (iii) Operating Costs (as defined in the Lease) that are not included in Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs (the Additional Rent payable by Subtenant, the “Applicable Additional Rent”).

(ii) Sublandlord shall give Subtenant written notice of Sublandlord’s estimate of the amount of Operating Costs per month payable pursuant to this Section 4.b for each calendar year of the Term following the Base Year (as defined below), promptly following the Sublandlord’s receipt of Landlord’s estimate of the Operating Costs payable under the Lease for the applicable calendar year. Such estimate may be adjusted by Sublandlord if Landlord has made such an adjustment from time to time during the calendar year, by written notice to Subtenant. From and after January 1, 2013, on or before the first day of each month during each calendar year, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord as Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs one-twelfth (1/12th) of such estimated amount together with the Base Rent.

 

2.

(iii) Sublandlord shall also give Subtenant written notice of the actual amount of Operating Costs payable for each calendar year, promptly following Sublandlord’s receipt of the annual statement of such amounts from Landlord, which notice shall include a copy of Landlord’s annual statement. If on the basis of such statement Subtenant owes an amount that is less than the estimated payments for the calendar year just ended, previously paid by Subtenant, Sublandlord shall credit such excess to the next payments of Base Rent coming due or, if the term of this Sublease is about to expire, refund such excess to Subtenant within thirty (30) days after such expiration. If on the basis of such statement Subtenant owes an amount that is more than the estimated payments for the calendar year just ended previously made by Subtenant, Subtenant shall pay the deficiency to Sublandlord within thirty (30) days after delivery of the statement from Sublandlord to Subtenant.

(iv) For partial calendar years during the term of this Sublease, the amount of Operating Costs payable by Subtenant that is applicable to that partial calendar year shall be prorated based on the ratio of the number of days of such partial calendar year falling during the term of this Sublease divided by 365. The obligations of Subtenant and Sublandlord pursuant to this Section 4.b which arise during the term of this Sublease shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease.

(v) The amounts of any Applicable Additional Rent due from Subtenant during the Term of this Sublease shall be paid by Subtenant to Sublandlord within ten (10) days of an itemized invoice from Sublandlord for such amounts.

(vi) For purposes of this Sublease and in addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Sublease, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

(1) “Base Operating Costs” shall mean Operating Costs payable under the Lease during the Base Year.

(2) “Base Year” shall mean the calendar year 2012.

(3) “Subtenant’s Percentage Share” shall mean 14.985%; provided that Sublandlord and Subtenant acknowledge that Subtenant’s Percentage Share has been obtained by dividing the rentable square footage of the Subleased Premises by the total rentable square footage of the Premises and multiplying such quotient by 100. In the event Subtenant’s Percentage Share is changed during a calendar year by reason of a change in the rentable square footage of the Subleased Premises or the Premises, Subtenant’s Percentage Share shall thereupon be adjusted to equal the result obtained by dividing the rentable square footage of the Subleased Premises by the rentable square footage of the Premises and multiplying such quotient by 100, and Subtenant’s Percentage Share shall be determined on the basis of the number of days during such calendar year at each such percentage share.

(c) Payment. Subtenant shall commence to pay Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs from and after January 1, 2013, and to pay Base Rent, Applicable Additional Rent and all other charges hereunder on the Commencement Date, and shall continue to pay Base Rent and Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs in monthly installments on or before the first day of every month thereafter during the Term. The monthly installments

 

3.

of Base Rent and Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs shall be prorated on a per diem basis for the first or last month of the Term if the Commencement Date or Expiration Date is not the first day or last day of a calendar month. For purposes of this Sublease, the word “Rent.” shall mean the Base Rent, Subtenant’s Percentage Share of Operating Costs, Applicable Additional Rent, and all other charges payable to Sublandlord by Subtenant pursuant to this Sublease.

5. Security Deposit. Concurrent with Subtenant’s execution of this Sublease, Subtenant shall deliver to Sublandlord the sum of $84,800.76 (the “Deposit”) as security for the performance by Subtenant of its obligations under this Sublease. If Subtenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period, the Deposit shall be returned to Subtenant upon the expiration or termination of this Sublease. If Subtenant defaults in respect of any of the terms, provisions, covenants or conditions of this Sublease beyond any applicable notice and cure period, including, but not limited to, payment of Rent, Sublandlord may, but shall not be required to, use, apply or retain the whole or any appropriate part of the Deposit for the payment of any Rent in default or for reimbursement of any reasonable expense that Sublandlord incurs because of Subtenant’s default. If the Deposit is so applied then Subtenant shall, within ten (10) days after Sublandlord’s written request, deposit additional money with Sublandlord sufficient to restore the Deposit to its original amount.

6. Data Cabling. During the Term of this Sublease, Subtenant shall be entitled to use those portions of the existing cabling in the Subleased Premises as may be necessary for Subtenant’s use of the Subleased Premises as general office space. Subtenant shall not be responsible for removing the existing cabling upon the expiration of this Sublease.

7. Use; Access. The Subleased Premises shall be used and occupied only for general office purposes as permitted under the Lease. Sublandlord shall provide Subtenant with card keys to access the Subleased Premises and Subtenant shall reimburse Sublandlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice for the cost of any card keys supplied by Sublandlord to Subtenant for purposes of access to the Subleased Premises.

8. Alterations. Subtenant shall not make any alterations to the Subleased Premises without the prior written consent of Sublandlord and Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any alterations consented to shall he subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the Lease (including, without limitation, the provisions of Article 17 of the Lease), and shall be performed in compliance with applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublandlord hereby consents to Subtenant completing, at Subtenant’s sole cost, the improvements within, to and servicing the Subleased Premises (the “Subtenant Improvements”) described on Exhibit C-1 attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein, in accordance with plans approved by Landlord in accordance with Section 17.2 of the Lease.

9. Maintenance. From and after the Commencement Date, Subtenant shall be responsible for all of Sublandlord’s maintenance obligations under the Lease with respect to the Subleased Premises. Subtenant acknowledges that the Building hours are from 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays (Sundays and nationally enacted holidays excepted), and that additional after-hours HVAC services are available to Subtenant upon request and payable by Subtenant at Landlord’s then-current rates.

 

4.

10. Parking. Subtenant acknowledges that Sublandlord’s right to parking for the Building is limited by the terms and conditions set forth in Section 15.2 of the Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublandlord shall sublease to Subtenant fifteen (15) of the parking spaces (“Subtenant Parking Spaces”) available to Sublandlord under the Lease at the same rates as Sublandlord pays under the Lease (currently $75.00 per stall per month, increasing to $100.00 per stall per month for the period August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2015, and at market rates for such stalls thereafter but in no event shall rates increase more frequently than annually thereafter), subject to the restrictions set forth in the Lease. Sublandlord shall not exercise its rights under the Lease to relinquish the Subtenant Parking Spaces without Subtenant’s prior written consent.

11. Assignment and Subletting. Subtenant shall not assign or sublet all or any portion of the Subleased Premises without Sublandlord’s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, nor without Landlord’s prior written consent under Article 8 of the Lease, provided, however, Subtenant may make a “Permitted Transfer” (as defined in the Lease), if all conditions of Section 8.6 of the Lease are satisfied (with Subtenant substituted for “Tenant” in such definition for the purposes of this Section 11), without Sublandlord consent.

12. Incorporation of Lease. This Sublease is and shall be at all times subject and subordinate to all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease and to all of the rights of Landlord thereunder. Subtenant shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Lease and shall not take any action which would constitute a breach or violation of the Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following sections of the Lease shall not be applicable to Subtenant: Sections 2.26, 4.4, 5.1, 5.3, Article 6, 8.4 (with respect to Sublandlord’s payment obligations resulting from its own acts or omissions), 12.3 (with respect to Sublandlord’s payment obligations resulting from its own acts or omissions), 15.2 (with respect to Sublandlord’s payment obligations resulting from its own acts or omissions), Article 24 (with respect to removal of any Alterations existing as of the Commencement Date), 30.9, 30.11 (with respect to Sublandlord’s payment obligations resulting from its own acts or omissions), 30.25, 30.26, 30.27, 30.28, Exhibit C, Exhibit D Sections 2.1 and 2.4, and Exhibit F (such, the “Excluded Provisions”). Subtenant acknowledges that Landlord may enforce the Lease provisions directly against Subtenant in the event of any such any breach or violation thereof by Subtenant. Neither Sublandlord nor Subtenant shall commit or suffer any act or omission that will result in a violation of or a default under any of the provisions of the Lease. Sublandlord represents and warrants to Subtenant that as of the date hereof and as of the Commencement Date, to Sublandlord’s best knowledge: (i) no default exists on the part of Landlord or Sublandlord under the Lease and (ii) there are no events which, with the passage of time, or the giving of notice, or both, would create a default under the Lease. Sublandlord covenants that it shall promptly provide Subtenant with copies of all notices of default sent or received by Sublandlord with respect to the Master Lease.

 

5.

13. Interpretation. The terms, conditions and respective obligations of Sublandlord and Subtenant to each other under this Sublease shall be the terms and conditions of the Lease except for the Excluded Provisions and those provisions of the Lease which are directly contradicted by this Sublease, in which event the terms of this Sublease shall control over the Lease, Therefore, for the purposes of this Sublease, wherever in the Lease the word “Landlord” is used, it shall also be deemed to mean the Sublandlord herein (except to the extent such references impose an obligation upon Landlord, in which case same shall not refer to Sublandlord, and wherever in the Lease the word “Tenant” is used, it shall be deemed to mean the Subtenant herein (except to the extent such provision is not incorporated herein). Without limiting the terms and provisions of this Section 13, Subtenant acknowledges and agrees that Subtenant’s rights under this Sublease are as a subtenant only and that, Subtenant shall not enjoy or be entitled to exercise any of rights, including, but not limited to, rights which may be afforded to Sublandlord as the tenant under the Lease, including, but not limited to: (a) any right of early termination or of extension or renewal of the Lease; (b) any right of first offer or refusal under the Lease; (c) any expansion rights or options under the Lease; (d) any right of self-help or set-off under the Lease except as expressly set forth herein; or (e) any other rights or options pertaining to additional space in the Building; provided, however, in the event Sublandlord receives an abatement of rent under Section 7.6 or 13.2 of the Lease, Subtenant shall also be entitled to a proportionate abatement of rent hereunder to the extent that the abatement received by Sublandlord relates to the partial destruction of the Subleased Premises. Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary contained anywhere else in this Sublease, (i) if Sublandlord or Subtenant is obligated to indemnify the other, whether pursuant to the express terms of this Sublease or whether pursuant to the incorporation of terms from the Lease, the indemnifying party shall also be obligated to indemnify Landlord to the same extent and subject to the same limitations; (ii) if Subtenant is obligated to name Sublandlord as an additional insured or loss payee under Subtenant’s insurance policies, whether pursuant to the express terms of this Sublease or whether pursuant to the terms of the Lease that are incorporated herein, Subtenant shall also name Landlord as an additional insured or loss payee, as the case may be, subject to the same limitations or conditions, if any, that may apply with regard to Sublandlord; and (iii) if Landlord’s consent or approval is required under the Lease in a provision of the Lease that is incorporated into this Sublease, Subtenant must obtain the consent or approval of both Sublandlord and Landlord, the granting of which by Landlord shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable Lease provision.

To the extent that Landlord fails or refuses to perform its obligations under the Lease or breaches or has breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants under the Lease, upon the written request of Subtenant, then Sublandlord agrees to use reasonable and good faith efforts to cause Landlord to perform its obligations under the Lease.

15. Indemnification. Subtenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sublandlord from and against all losses, costs, damages, expenses and liabilities, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, which Sublandlord may incur or pay out (including, without limitation, to Landlord) by reason of (a) any accidents, damages or injuries to persons or property occurring in the Subleased Premises after the Commencement Date (unless the same shall have been caused by Sublandlord’s negligence or wrongful act, or a

Landlord, Sublandlord and Subtenant shall require their respective insurance companies to include a standard waiver of subrogation provision in their respective policies.

ARTICLE 5. RENT

5.1 Payment.

(a) As consideration for this Lease, Tenant shall pay Landlord all Rent specified in this Lease. Base Rent is payable in advance on the first day of each month of the Term at the Rent Payment Address or such other address specified by Landlord. Additional Rent or sums other than Rent requested by Landlord under the terms of this Lease are payable within ten days of Notice or demand unless a different time period is expressly specified in the Lease. If the Term commences on other than the first clay of the month, the Rent for the first partial month shall be prorated accordingly.

(b) If Tenant exercises its renewal option, the Base Rental rate(s) for the Renewal Term shall be equal to the fair market rate(s), including all concessions, for a five (5) year term for a comparable lease for comparable Class A space located in Fremont/South Lake Union area of the City of Seattle (collectively “Fair Market Rent”). Landlord shall advise Tenant in writing of Landlord’s calculation of Fair Market Rent by no later than ten (10) months prior to the end of the base Lease Term. If Tenant disagrees with such calculation, it shall advise Landlord in writing thereof within twenty (20) days thereafter. If there is a disagreement on such calculation, the parties shall promptly meet to attempt to resolve their differences. If these differences as to Fair Market Rent arc not resolved within a two (2) month period, then the parties shall submit the matter to arbitration in accordance with the terms of Section 5.1(c) so that Fair Market Rent is determined no later than two (2) months prior to the end of the base Term of this Lease.

(c) If the parties are unable to reach agreement on Fair Market Rent during the period specified in Section 5.1(b), then within ten (10) days thereafter either party may advise the other in writing of the name and address of its arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be an appraiser or commercial real estate broker with at least ten (10) years of experience with

 

20

commercial rental rates in Fremont/South Lake Union area of the City of Seattle. Within ten (10) business days after receipt of such notice from the initiating party (the “Instigator”) designating its arbitrator, the other party (the “Recipient”) shall give notice to Instigator, specifying the name and address of the person designated by Recipient to act as arbitrator on its behalf who shall be similarly qualified. If Recipient fails to notify Instigator of the appointment of its arbitrator, within or by the time above specified, then the arbitrator appointed by Instigator shall be the arbitrator to determine the issue. The duty of the arbitrator(s) shall be to determine the Fair Market Rent. If the two (2) arbitrators are so chosen the arbitrators so chosen shall meet within ten (10) business days after the second arbitrator is appointed and, if within ten (10) business days after such first meeting the two arbitrators shall be unable to agree promptly upon a determination of Fair Market Rent, they, themselves, shall appoint a third arbitrator, who shall be a competent and impartial person with qualifications similar to those required of the first two arbitrators. If they are unable to agree upon such appointment within five (5) business days after expiration of said ten (10) day period, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the parties themselves, if they can agree thereon, within a further, period of ten (10) business days. If the parties do not so agree, then either party, on behalf of both, may request appointment of such a qualified person by the then presiding judge of King County Superior Court acting in his or her private non judicial capacity, and the other party shall not raise any question as to such judge’s full power and jurisdiction to entertain the application for and make the appointment, and the parties agree to indemnify and hold the presiding judge fully and completely harmless from and against all claims arising out of the presiding judge’s appointment of an arbitrator. The three (3) arbitrators shall decide the dispute, if it has not been previously resolved, by following the procedure set forth in this Section. Where the issue cannot be resolved by agreement between the two arbitrators selected by Landlord and Tenant or settlement between the parties during the course of arbitration, the issue shall be resolved by the three arbitrators in accordance with the following procedure. The arbitrators selected by each of the parties shall state in writing his or her determination of the Fair Market Rent supported by the reasons therefor with counterpart copies to each party. The arbitrators shall arrange for a simultaneous exchange of such proposed resolutions. The role of the third arbitrator shall be to select which of the two proposed resolutions most closely approximates his or her determination of Fair Market Rent. The third arbitrator shall have no right to propose a middle ground or any modification of either of the two proposed resolutions. The resolution he or she chooses as most closely approximating his or her determination shall constitute the decision of the arbitrators and be final and binding upon the parties.

(i) In the event of a failure, refusal or inability of any arbitrator to act, his or her successor shall be appointed by him, but in the case of the third arbitrator, his or her successor shall be appointed in the same manner as provided for appointment of the third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to decide the issue within ten (10) business days after the appointment of the third arbitrator. Any decision in which the arbitrator appointed by Landlord and the arbitrator appointed by Tenant concur shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties. Each party shall pay the fee and expenses of its respective arbitrator and both shall share equally the fee and expenses of the third arbitrator, if any, and the attorneys’ fees and expenses of counsel for the respective parties and of witnesses shall be paid by the respective party engaging such counsel or calling such witnesses.

 

21

The arbitrators shall have the right to consult experts and competent authorities with factual information or evidence pertaining to a determination of Fair Market Rent. The arbitrators shall render their decision and award in writing with counterpart copies to each party. The arbitrators shall have no power to modify the provisions of this Lease.

5.2 No Set Off. All Rent due under this Lease shall be paid without prior notice, demand, deduction, setoff, offset, counterclaim, suspension or abatement except as expressly provided in Articles 13 and 19.

5.3 Advance Rent. [Intentionally deleted].

5.4 Late Charges; Interest. Tenant acknowledges that late payment of Rent or other sums due under the Lease will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount being extremely difficult and impractical to fix. Such costs include processing and accounting charges, late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any encumbrance covering the Premises, and interest costs. If Landlord does not receive Rent or any other payment due from Tenant five (5) days after Notice from Landlord that such payment is past due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum of ten percent (10%) of such Rent or other payment as a late charge; provided, however, after the first notice in any twelve (12) month period, no further notice shall be required and the late charge shall be imposed after five (5) days. The Parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the cost Landlord will incur by reason of Tenant’s late payment. Accepting any late charge does not waive Tenant’s default with respect to the overdue amount or prevent Landlord from exercising any other rights or remedies available to Landlord. In addition to the late charge, Tenant shall pay interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum on any Rent or other sum not paid by the date due.

Landlord shall not be responsible or liable for any interruption or failure in utility, telecommunication or other services, including the Lines, so long as Landlord uses reasonable and diligent efforts to restore service and minimize any interruptions after receiving notice of any failure or interruption of service from Tenant, nor shall such interruption or failure affect the continuation or validity of this Lease; provided, that Base Rent and Additional Rent shall abate during any period that Tenant is unable to conduct normal business operations in the Premises as a result of such an interruption that is attributable to Landlord’s negligence or breach of this Lease and continues for longer than two (2) business days, but only for the period thereafter. Tenant acknowledges that any one or more such services may be suspended or reduced by reason of unavoidable emergency repairs, by strikes or accidents, by any cause beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, or by orders or regulations of any federal, state, county or municipal authority. In addition, Landlord shall have no liability for damages arising from, and Landlord does not warrant that Tenant’s use of any Lines will be free from, (a) any eavesdropping or wire-tapping by unauthorized parties, (b) any failure of any Lines to satisfy Tenant’s requirements, or

Landlord shall use reasonable, diligent and good faith efforts to minimize the impact and duration of any shortages, failures, variations, interruptions, disconnections.

The immediately preceding sentence will not apply to public corporations, the stock of which is traded through a public exchange.

8.2 Transfer Notice. If Tenant desires to effect a Transfer, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date when Tenant desires the Transfer to be effective (the “Transfer Date”), Tenant will give Notice (the “Transfer Notice”), stating the name, address and business of the proposed assignee, subtenant or other transferee (the “Transferee”) a description of the Premises, or portion thereof, to be Transferred (the “Transfer Premises”), the proposed Transfer Date, the relationship, if any, between Tenant and the Transferee, a current balance sheet and most recent quarterly and annual profit and loss statement and a business history of the Transferee.

Within ten (10) days of receipt of a Transfer Notice and all financial information, Landlord will notify Tenant of its election to do one of the following: (i) consent to the proposed Transfer subject to such reasonable conditions as Landlord may impose in providing such consent (which shall not entail changes to the rights or the obligations of either party under the Lease); (ii) refuse such consent, which refusal shall be on reasonable grounds; or (iii) terminate this Lease as to any portion of the Premises which is proposed to be assigned, or any portion of the Premises Which exceeds, individually or in the aggregate when combined with prior subleases, 6,700 square feet which is proposed to be sublet, and recapture that portion of the Premises for reletting by Landlord, unless Tenant elects to terminate the Transfer and retain the Premises.

8.4 Additional Conditions. A condition precedent to any Transfer will be the delivery to Landlord of evidence of insurance as required under the Lease and the correct legal name and notice address for the Transferee. Tenant (“Transferor”) agrees to pay Landlord, as Additional Rent, seventy-five percent (75%) of all sums and other consideration payable to and for the benefit of Tenant by the Transferee in excess of the Rent payable under the Lease for the same period and portion of the Premises. In calculating excess Rent-or other consideration which may be payable to Landlord under this paragraph, Tenant will be entitled to deduct a monthly amortization of commercially reasonable third party brokerage commissions and attorney’s fees and other amounts reasonably and actually expended by Tenant in connection with the Transfer if acceptable written evidence of such expenditures is provided to Landlord. No Transfer will release Transferor (or any prior Transferor) of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or-alter the primary liability of Transferor (or any prior Transferor) to perform all obligations to be performed by Tenant hereunder. Landlord may require that Transferee remit directly to Landlord on a monthly basis, all monies due Transferor by said Transferee. Consent by Landlord to one Transfer will not be deemed consent to any subsequent Transfer. In the event of default by Transferee, Tenant or any successor of Tenant in the performance of any other terms hereof; Landlord may proceed directly against Transferor without the necessity of exhausting remedies against Transferee or successor. If Tenant requests the consent of Landlord to a Transfer, Tenant will pay Landlord a review fee of $500.00 and shall also reimburse Landlord for all of Landlord’s reasonable attorney’s fees.

8.5 Recapture. By Notice to Tenant (the “Termination Notice”) within ten (10) days after Landlord receives the information specified in Section 8.2, Landlord may terminate this Lease in the event of a Transfer of the Lease as to the entire Premises, or terminate this Lease as to the portion of the Premises to be transferred, if the Transfer is for less than the entire Premises, unless Tenant elects to terminate the Transfer and retain the Premises as provided in Section 8.3 above. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease as to the Transfer Premises, an amendment to this Lease shall be executed restating the description of the Premises and reducing Tenant’s obligations for Rent and other charges in proportion to the reduction in rentable area of the Premises. In the event Landlord elects to recapture Tenant may elect to terminate the transfer and retain the premises. In such event, unless the parties otherwise agree, the date, on which the termination shall take effect, shall be the date of the proposed transfer identified in Tenant’s notice. If Landlord elects a whole or partial termination hereunder, Landlord may enter into a

 

25

new lease with the intended Transferee or any other person covering the Transfer Premises on such terms as Landlord and such person may agree. In such event, Tenant shall not be entitled to any portion of the profit that Landlord may realize on account of such termination and reletting. Upon the termination of this Lease, the Parties shall have no further obligations to each other under this Lease except for matters occurring or obligations arising prior to the date of such termination.

(b) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided.

Alterations, acts of maintenance or preservation, efforts to relet the Premises, the appointment of a receiver upon initiation of Landlord or other legal proceeding granting Landlord or its agent possession to protect Landlord’s interest under this Lease shall not constitute a termination of Tenant’s right to possession.

(b) If Landlord elects to relet, the Rent received by Landlord from reletting shall be applied in the following order: (1) to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant; (2) to the payment of any cost of reletting, including brokerage fees; (3) to the payment of the cost of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; (4) to the payment of Rent due and unpaid hereunder; and (5) any residue shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder.

Tenant shall also pay to Landlord when ascertained, any costs and expenses inclined by Landlord in such reletting or in making such alterations and repairs not covered by the Rents received from such reletting.

 

38

(c) No reentry or taking possession of the Premises or any other action under this Section shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a Notice of such intention be given to Tenant or unless the termination thereof be decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any relating without termination by Landlord because of any default by Tenant, Landlord may at any time after such reletting elect to terminate this Lease for any such default.

23.4 No Waiver. Efforts by Landlord to mitigate the damages caused by Tenant’s default in this Lease shall not constitute a waiver of Landlord’s right to recover damages hereunder.

23.5 Curing Defaults. If Tenant fails to repair, maintain, keep clean, or service any of the Premises or fails to perform any other Lease obligation, then after having given Tenant reasonable Notice of any failure and a reasonable opportunity to remedy the failure, which in no case shall exceed twenty (20) days, Landlord may enter upon the Premises and perform or contract for the performance of the repair, maintenance, or other Tenant obligation, and .Tenant shall pay Landlord as Additional Rent all direct and indirect costs incurred in connection therewith.

23.6 Cumulative Remedies. The various rights, options, election powers, and remedies of Landlord contained in this Article and elsewhere in this Lease are cumulative. None of them is exclusive of any others or of any legal or equitable remedy that Landlord might otherwise have in the event of breach or default, and the exercise of one right or remedy by Landlord will not in any way impair its right to any other right or remedy.

Failure to comply with this Article within the ten-day period set forth above shall be an immediate breach of this Lease by Tenant, without opportunity to cure, giving Landlord all rights and remedies under Article 23 hereof, as well as a right to damages caused by the loss of a loan, lease or sale which may result from such failure by Tenant.

The Successor-in-Interest shall not be (1) bound by any payment of Rent for more than thirty (30) days in advance; (ii) bound by any modification or amendment of this Lease to shorten the term or decrease the Base Rent or otherwise materially changes the terms of this Lease without the consent of the Lender or ground lessor; (iii) liable for any act or omission of Landlord or any previous landlord, except to the extent the same constitutes a continuing event of default after such party succeeds to Landlord’s interest; (iv) bound by any obligation of Landlord under the Lease that is not reasonably susceptible to performance by the Successor-in-Interest; (v) subject to any offset, defense, recoupment or counterclaim that Tenant may have as against Landlord or any previous landlord (other than with respect to a breach of Landlord’s obligations under the Lease that continues to exist after the Successor-in-Interest succeeds to Landlord’s interest); or (vi) liable for any deposit with the exception of prepaid rent that Tenant may have made with respect to Landlord or previous landlord that has not been transferred to the Successor-in-Interest (collectively, the “Lender Carve Outs”). Within ten business (10) days

 

40

after Notice of a request by Successor-in-Interest, Tenant shall deliver an executed attornment agreement in a form required by such Successor-in-Interest (including non-disturbance provisions), so long as the same do not materially change the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, except insofar as any of the Lender Carve Outs apply.

27.2 Financing, Sale or Transfer. If Landlord desires to finance, refinance, sell, or otherwise transfer the Premises, Building or Complex, or any part thereof, Tenant agrees, within ten (10) business days of request therefor by Landlord, to deliver to Landlord and any lender, prospective buyer or transferee designated by Landlord financial statements of Tenant and any parent company as may be reasonably required by such party.

All such parties agree that they will not seek Court permission to extend such time for assumption or rejection. Failure to assume or reject in the time set forth herein shall mean that the Lease may be terminated at Landlord’s option. Rejection of the Lease shall be a default under the Lease.

(b) If the Lease is assumed by a debtor, receiver, assignee or trustee, such party shall immediately after such assumption (1) cure any default or provide adequate assurances that defaults will be promptly cured; (2) pay Landlord for actual pecuniary loss or provide adequate assurances that compensation will be made for such loss; and (3) provide adequate assurance of future performance.

The term “vacant and available for lease” as used in this Section shall mean that such space has been vacated by the previous tenant and is not subject to any prior options to expand, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal held by any other tenant or third party. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord may elect to enter into new lease(s) with existing tenant(s) of part or all of the RFO Space and that if Landlord does so, then the portion of the RFO space occupied by such existing tenant(s) shall not be deemed vacant and available for lease, Landlord shall only be obligated to submit an Offer Notice to Tenant under this Section 30.27 or to lease RFO Space to Tenant under this Section 30.27 if: (a) Tenant is not in default under this Lease and would not be but for the passage of time or the giving of notice; (b) Tenant has not previously been in default under this Lease beyond the applicable cure period; (c) Tenant has not previously assigned this Lease or sublet any part of the Premises individually or in the aggregate, individually or in the aggregate in excess of 6,700 square feet; (d) this Lease is in full force and effect; (e) Tenant’s or Guarantor’s net worth and/or net current assets are not below the level which existed at the time this Lease was signed; and (f) Tenant is not the subject of a petition in bankruptcy, has not made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or has not had a receiver appointed with respect to it or to a material portion of its assets.

30.28 Communication Device. Tenant shall have the right to install an antenna or satellite “dish” or similar device for the reception and transmission of signals of a size approved by Landlord (“Device”) on the roof of the Complex in a location selected by Landlord, but only for Tenant’s own use and only in accordance with the terms of this Section 30.28. The Device shall be installed, maintained, operated, repaired and removed at the end of the Term, or its earlier termination, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, Tenant shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and ordinances relating to the installation, use, maintenance, repair or removal of the Device and shall not permit it to be operated in a manner which will interfere with other tenant’s Devices. The plans for the Device and its location shall be provided to Landlord for its review and approval at least thirty (30) days prior to its installation of the Device, and Tenant shall comply with Landlord’s directions with regard to its installation, use, maintenance, repair and removal. Tenant shall install the Device in such manner as will not reduce the coverage afforded Landlord under its roof warranty and shall reimburse Landlord for all of Landlord’s costs reasonably incurred in connection with the installation, use, maintenance, repair or removal of the Device within ten (10) days of Tenant’s receipt of each invoice thereafter. If Landlord so requires, Tenant shall at its sole expense provide a double membrane over the roof to be used as a walkway for Device installation, service, maintenance and removal. Tenant shall remove the Device as and when necessary for Landlord’s roof maintenance work and at the end of the Lease term or upon its earlier termination and shall repair any damage resulting from its removal.

WORK LETTER

1. Improvements Allowance.

1.1 Allowance. Landlord shall provide Tenant with an allowance of Forty and 89/100 Dollars ($40.89) per RSF of Premises area (the “Allowance”). Landlord agrees to reimburse Tenant for the Cost of Tenant’s Work, as hereinafter defined, up to the total of the Allowance, in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.

1.2 Cost of Tenant’s Work. As used herein the “Cost of Tenant’s Work” means the following out-of-pocket improvements casts incurred by Tenant in performing Tenants Work:

(a) Payments to contractors and subcontractors.

(b) Fees for building permits and inspections;

(c) Fees of Tenant’s engineers, surveyors, architects, attorneys and others providing professional or other services in connection with the construction of Tenant’s Work or the supervision thereof;

(d) Other direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with Tenant’s Work; and

(e) All costs necessary to keep the HVAC systems for the Premises in balance and fully operational and to ensure that all Premises systems are fully operational.

The Cost of Tenant’s Work does not include the cost of acquiring, delivering or installing Tenant’s furniture, fixtures or equipment.

1.3 Disbursement. Landlord shall disburse directly to Tenant, the Cost of Tenant’s Work, but not in excess of the Allowance within thirty (30) days following receipt of a schedule reflecting such costs, together with paid invoices supporting such costs, and satisfaction of all of the following conditions, but in no event earlier than July 16, 2010:

(a) Receipt by Landlord of a set of “as built” drawings for Tenants Work and a copy of all warranties, in effect, with respect to Tenant’s Work;

(b) Receipt by Landlord of a certificate from Tenant’s architect that all of Tenant’s Work has been fully completed and all punch list items have been corrected;

(c) Receipt by Landlord of evidence of payment by Tenant of all other costs, including extras and change orders, if any, with respect to Tenant’s Work in excess of the Allowance;

 

59

(e) Issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the Premises by the City of Seattle, if required; and

(f) The Term of the Lease has commenced.

No payment shall be made while Tenant is in default under this Lease or the Sublease.

If, and to the extent that the full Allowance is not spent on the cost of Tenant’s Work, then so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease or the Sublease, upon Tenant’s request on or after July 16, 2010 Landlord shall apply any remaining balance of the Allowance to the Rents coming due under this Lease until the remaining balance has been exhausted, If this Lease is terminated prior to exhaustion of the remaining balance of the Allowance, all Tenant rights as to the then-remaining balance shall terminate.

EXPENSES, TAXES AND INSURANCE COSTS

1. Definitions.

1.1 “Excluded Costs” are all of the following: Capital Costs (to the extent not permitted by Section 2.5); depreciation; principal or interest payments of mortgage and other debts of Landlord; the cost of repairs or other work to the extent Landlord is reimbursed by insurance or condemnation proceeds; costs in connection with leasing space in the Building, including brokerage commissions, lease concessions, rental abatements and construction allowances granted to specific tenants; costs incurred in connection with the sale, financing or refinancing of the Complex; fines, interest and penalties incurred due to the late payment of Taxes or Expenses; or any penalties or damages that Landlord pays to tenants in the Complex under their respective leases; and excluding the following:

(i) Property management fees in excess of four percent (4%) of the Base Rent payable under the Lease;

(ii) Executive’s salaries above the grade of general manager;

(iii) Expenditures which under generally accepted accounting principles are considered capital expenditures, except to the extent of Capital Costs defined in Section 2.5 of the Lease;

(iv) Consulting fees, marketing fees, advertising and promotional expenditures;

(v) Legal, accounting and auditing fees, other than legal, accounting and auditing fees reasonably incurred in connection with the maintenance and operation of the Property or in connection with the preparation of the statements required pursuant to the Lease;

(vi) Rents payable in connection with any ground or underlying lease of all or any portion of the Property;

(vii) Penalties due to any violation of law by Landlord or other tenants;

(viii) Costs of preparing tenant space for tenant occupancy;

(ix) Costs of any utilities, services, or capital improvements relating to all or any portion of the Property which were paid directly by Tenant or any other tenant;

(x) Damages incurred by Landlord for any of its defaults under any leases or contracts relating to the Building or Complex, or breaches of law;

(xi) Premium rates paid on service or other contracts, except in an emergency; and

(xii) Landlord’s general administrative overhead.

 

61

1.2 “Pro Rata Percent” is a fraction the numerator of which is the Rentable Area of the Premises and the denominator of which is the Rentable Area of the Building. Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent as of the Commencement Date is specified in Section 1.11 of the Lease, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent will be recalculated as required effective at the commencement of any period to which the calculation is applicable in this Lease. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent as to certain expenses may be calculated differently to yield a higher percentage share for Tenant as to certain expenses in the event Landlord permits other tenants in the Complex to directly incur such expenses rather than have Landlord incur the expense in common for the Complex (such as, by way of illustration, wherein a tenant performs its own janitorial services). In such case Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent of the applicable expense shall be calculated as having as its denominator the Rentable Area of the Building less the Rentable Area of tenants who have incurred such expense directly. Furthermore, in the event Tenant consumes extraordinary amounts of any provided utility or other service as determined in Landlord’s good faith judgment, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent for such utility or service may, at Landlord’s election, be based on usage as opposed to Rentable Area of the Building, that is, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent of such a utility or service would be calculated as having as its denominator the total usage of such utility or service in the Complex (or Building as the case may be), and having as its numerator Tenant’s usage of such utility or service, as determined by Landlord. If Tenant, with Landlord’s consent, which Landlord may grant or withhold in its arbitrary judgment, incurs such expenses directly, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent will be calculated specially so that expenses of the same character which are incurred by Landlord for the benefit of other tenants in the Complex shall not be prorated to Tenant. If repairs are required for systems exclusively serving the Premises (whether within or outside of said Premises) and Landlord historically has not passed through such costs as Operating Cost borne by all tenants of the Building or Complex, then Tenant shall pay one hundred percent of such repair costs; provided however, if the costs are of a capital nature they shall be amortized and charged to Tenant in the same way that Capital Costs are amortized and charged under the Lease.

2. Additional Rent.

2.1 Operating Costs. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Tenant’s Pro Rata Percent of the Operating Costs for the Building or Complex, as the case may be, for any Lease Year, calculated by multiplying the Pro Rata Percent times (a) the greater of either (i) actual Operating Costs; or (ii) Operating Costs computed as if the Building or Complex were at least ninety-five percent (95%) occupied and operational for the whole Lease Year. If any Lease Year of less than twelve months is included within the Term, the amount payable by Tenant for such period shall be prorated on a per diem basis (using a 360-day year).

2.2 Personal Property, Gross Receipts, Leasing Taxes. This Section is intended to deal with taxes directly attributed to Tenant or this transaction, as distinct from Taxes attributable to the Complex which are to be allocated among various tenants and others and which are included in Operating Costs. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all taxes required to be paid by Landlord, whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto, which are: (a) upon, measured by, or reasonably attributable to (i) the cost or value of Tenant’s equipment, furniture, fixtures and other personal property located in the Premises or (ii) if separately assessed by the tax assessor, the cost or value of any Leasehold Improvements made in or to the Premises by or for Tenant, other than Building Standard Work, regardless of

 

62

whether title to such improvements shall be in Tenant or Landlord; (b) upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion thereof to the extent such taxes are not included as Taxes and are not a gross receipts -tax or Business and Occupations tax, provided, however, if after the date of this Lease, any new taxes or assessments are imposed that are based upon rents received from Tenant and are not otherwise included in Taxes, Landlord shall be entitled to collect reimbursement for such taxes or assessments from Tenant; and (c) upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises.

2.3 Refuse Disposal. Tenant shall pay Landlord, within ten days of being billed therefor, for the removal from the Common Area, the Complex, or the Building of any amounts of refuse or rubbish that Tenant has generated in excess of amounts typically generated by other tenants of the Complex or of typical types of waste. However, Landlord shall have no responsibility for the removal of medical or dental wastes which shall be wholly Tenant’s responsibility as detailed in the Lease.

2.4 Method of Payment. Any Additional Rent payable by Tenant under Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 hereof shall be paid as follows, unless otherwise provided: (a) During the Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord monthly in advance with its payment of Base Rent, one-twelfth of the amount of such Additional Rent as estimated by Landlord in advance, in good faith, to be due from Tenant during the Lease Year; and (b) annually, within ten business days after receipt of Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement. As soon as is reasonably possible after the expiration of each Lease Year, Landlord shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Tenant a comparative statement setting forth (1) the Operating Costs for such Lease Year, and (2) the amount of any other Additional Rent as determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section (“Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement”). If the aggregate amount of estimated Additional Rent payments made by Tenant in any Lease Year is less than the Additional Rent due for such year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent the amount of such deficiency. Any delay in Landlord delivering the Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement shall not relieve Tenant from its obligation to pay any Additional Rent. If the aggregate amount of such Additional Rent payments made by Tenant in any Lease Year of the Term should be greater than the Additional Rent due for such year, Landlord will apply the amount of such excess to the next succeeding installments of Base Rent or such Additional Rent due hereunder; and if there is any such excess for the last year of the Term, the amount thereof will be refunded by Landlord to Tenant, within 45 days after the expiration of the Lease, to the extent Tenant is not otherwise in default under the terms of this Lease.

3. Audit Rights. Not later than 120 days of receiving Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement, Tenant may give Landlord written notice (“Review Notice”) that Tenant intends to review Landlord’s records of the Operating Costs for the Lease Year to which the statement applies. Within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Review Notice, Landlord shall make all pertinent records available for inspection that are reasonably necessary for Tenant to conduct its review. If any records are maintained at a location other than the management office for the Building, Tenant may either inspect the records at such other location or pay for the reasonable cost of copying and shipping the records, If Tenant retains an agent to review Landlord’s records, the agent must be with a CPA firm licensed to do business in the State. No audit may be

 

63

conducted wholly or partially on a contingent fee basis. Tenant is solely responsible for all costs, expenses and fees incurred for the audit, unless the Operating Costs were overstated by more than 5% in which case Landlord shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket cost of the audit. Within ninety (90) days after the records are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to give Landlord written notice (an “Objection Notice”) stating in reasonable detail any objection to Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement for that Lease Year. If Tenant fails to give Landlord an Objection Notice within the 90-day period or fails to provide Landlord with a Review Notice within the 120-day period described above, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved Landlord’s Operating Cost Statement and shall be barred from raising any claims regarding the Expenses for that Lease Year. The records obtained by Tenant shall be treated as confidential. In no event shall Tenant be permitted to examine Landlord’s records or to dispute any Operating Cost Statement unless Tenant shall not be in default under this Lease.

The obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of Tenant, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor, regardless of whether an action is brought against Tenant and regardless of whether Tenant is joined in such action or actions. The liability of Guarantor hereunder is primary and shall not be affected or diminished by any transfer, of Tenant’s interest in the Lease.

Guarantor authorizes Landlord, without notice or demand and without affecting Guarantor’s liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) accelerate or otherwise change the time for payments under or otherwise change the terms of, the Lease or any part thereof, by agreement with Tenant; (b) release or substitute any one or more guarantors; (c) modify or alter the liability of Tenant under the Lease; or (d) to settle or compromise any claim of Landlord against Tenant. Landlord may assign the Lease and/or this Guaranty in whole or in part, without notice and without in any manner affecting Guarantor’s obligations hereunder.

Guarantor waives any right to require Landlord to (a) proceed against Tenant; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Tenant; or (c) pursue any other remedy in Landlord’s power whatsoever. Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Tenant or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Tenant. Until all obligations of Tenant to Landlord under the Lease shall have been fully paid and performed, Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, and waives any right to enforce any remedy which Landlord now has or may hereafter have against Tenant, and waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by Landlord, Except for the right to receive notice of default as set forth below, and the cure periods provided to Tenant under the Lease, Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, notices of

 

68

nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness and all other notices of every kind and nature to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled as a matter of law.

Any indebtedness of Tenant now or hereafter held by Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the indebtedness of Tenant to Landlord and such indebtedness of Tenant to Guarantor, if Landlord so requests, shall be collected, enforced and received by Guarantor as a trustee for Landlord and be paid over to Landlord on account of the indebtedness of Tenant to it, but without reduction or affecting in any manner the liability of Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Until such time as the Lease has been paid and performed in full, Guarantor agrees not to exercise any rights any of them may now or hereafter acquire against Tenant (whether by subrogation, reimbursement, or otherwise) arising out of payments to Landlord hereunder. Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes in favor of Landlord and Tenant any claim or right to payment Guarantor may now have or hereafter have or acquire against Tenant, by subrogation or otherwise.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Guaranty, in the event Guarantor (i) sells or transfers (including without limitation a transfer resulting from a sale of stock or a merger, consolidation or reorganization) a controlling ownership interest in Tenant to a Qualified Transferee (as defined below), and provides to Landlord a substitute guaranty executed by such Qualified Transferee in substantially the same form, and with the same legal effect, as this Guaranty, or (ii) provides to Landlord a substitute for this Guaranty in the form of a letter of credit in a form, from an issuer and in an amount acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion, then in either case this Guaranty shall be deemed terminated and Guarantor shall be released from all further liability under this Guaranty and/or the Lease accruing after the date of the substitution. The term “Qualified Transferee” shall mean any person or entity having an audited Tangible Net Worth (as defined below) not less than 550,300,000 Swedish Krona, being the Tangible Net Worth of Guarantor as of the date hereof. The term “Tangible Net Worth” shall Mean the excess of total assets over total liabilities, in each case as determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), excluding, however, from the determination of total assets all assets which would be classified as intangible assets under IFRS, including goodwill, customer relations, licenses, patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights and franchises.

Guarantor agrees that it is not necessary for Landlord to inquire into the powers of Tenant or any officers, directors or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder. Guarantor warrants that this Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary authorities.

The Guarantor agrees to assume full responsibility for keeping itself informed as to the financial condition of Tenant and all other circumstances bearing upon risk of non-payment or non-performance of the Obligations which diligent inquiry would reveal with Lender to have no duty to advise the Guarantor of any information, whether known to Landlord or otherwise, regarding the financial or other condition of Tenant.

 

69

This Guaranty shall bind the successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assigns of Landlord. In the event that the Lease is assigned or transferred by Landlord (“Landlord Assignment”), this Guaranty may likewise be assigned and/or endorsed by Landlord to the assignee of the Lease (assignment of the Lease to also be deemed to be an assignment of this Guaranty), and in such event, the holder of this Guaranty may enforce this Guaranty as if such holder had been originally named as the Landlord hereunder.

This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceedings against Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty may be brought in the courts of the State of Washington sitting in King County, Washington, or in any United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and by Guarantor’s execution and delivery of this Guaranty, Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to each such jurisdiction and hereby irrevocably waives any and all objections which Guarantor may have as to venue in any of such courts.

Guarantor agrees to pay all costs of enforcement of this Guaranty, including Landlord’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and all costs and expenses of suit and in preparation therefor and on appeal therefrom. Any sums due hereunder which are not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate specified for delinquent payments in the lease.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect and shall be unaffected by any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of Tenant or any successor or assign of Tenant or any disaffirmance or rejection of the Lease by a trustee of Tenant or any trustee of any successor or assign of Tenant.

The Guarantor hereby waives its right to a jury trial with respect to any legal proceeding involving or enforcing this Guaranty.

Landlord agrees to provide Guarantor with a copy (if any written notice of default given by Landlord to Tenant. Any notices to be sent to Guarantor shall be given by and be effective upon personal delivery or deposit with any recognized overnight delivery services (such as Federal Express) addressed to Guarantor at the address set forth below the signature line below, or at any replacement address designated in writing received by Landlord not later than ten (10) days prior to any such notice by Landlord.

This instrument may not be changed, modified, discharged, or terminated orally or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing signed by Guarantor and the Landlord.

If any provision of this Guaranty or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall, for any reason and to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Guaranty and the application of that provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected but rather shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law. This Guaranty shall be construed without regard to any presumption or other rule requiring construction against the party causing this Guaranty to be drafted.

1. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to modify, waive or affect (i) any of the provisions, covenants or conditions in the Master Lease, (ii) any of Tenant’s obligations under the Master Lease or those of any guarantor (“Guarantor”) of Tenant’s obligations under the Master Lease, or (iii) any rights or remedies of Landlord under the Master Lease or otherwise or to enlarge or increase Landlord’s obligations or Tenant’s rights under the Master Lease or otherwise or be construed to waive any present or future breach or default on the part of Tenant or Sublessee under the Master Lease.

2. Nothing contained herein shall release or discharge Tenant or Guarantor from any liability under the Master Lease, and Tenant and Guarantor shall remain primarily liable and responsible for the full performance and observance of all of the provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in the Master Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed and observed. Any breach or violation of any provisions of the Master Lease by Sublessee shall be deemed to be and shall constitute a default by Tenant in fulfilling such provision. Tenant shall be obligated to pay Landlord upon demand all reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs resulting from disputes or lawsuits in which Landlord is involved as a consequence of disagreements between Tenant and Sublessee or the bankruptcy or insolvency of Sublessee.

3. The Sublease is subordinate to the Master Lease, and any termination of the Master Lease shall result in an automatic termination of the Sublease unless otherwise first agreed in writing by Landlord.

4. Sublessee shall have no right to enforce Tenant’s rights under the Master Lease, all of which enforcement rights are personal to Tenant.

5. Landlord’s consent shall not be construed as a consent by Landlord to any further sublease. Landlord’s consent shall be required for any amendment or modification of the Sublease. Sublessee’s interest under the Sublease may not be assigned, transferred or encumbered, nor shall the Premises, or any part thereof, be further sublet without the express prior written consent of Landlord.

6. Tenant shall be and continue to remain liable for all bills and charges incurred by or imposed under the Master Lease for services rendered and materials supplied to the Premises during the term of the Master Lease. While Tenant consents thereto, Landlord’s acceptance of a payment from Sublessee shall not be deemed an attornment by Sublessee to Landlord or to release Tenant from liability.

7. Upon the expiration or any earlier termination of the term of the Master Lease, or in case of the surrender of the Master Lease by Tenant to Landlord, except as provided in the following sentence, the Sublease and its term shall expire and come to an end as of the effective date of such expiration, termination, or surrender and Sublessee shall vacate the subleased premises on or before such date. If the Master Lease shall expire or terminate during the term of the Sublease for any reason other than condemnation or destruction by fire or other cause, or if Tenant shall surrender the Master Lease to Landlord during the term of the Sublease, Landlord, in its sole discretion (upon written notice given to Tenant and Sublessee not more than thirty (30) days after the effective date of such expiration, termination or surrender and without any additional or further agreement of any kind on the part of Sublessee), may elect to continue the Sublease with the same force and effect as if Landlord as lessor and Sublessee as lessee had entered into a lease as of such effective date for a term equal to the then unexpired term of the Sublease and containing the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Sublease. In such event, Sublessee shall attorn to Landlord and Landlord and Sublessee shall have the same rights, obligations and remedies thereunder as were had by Tenant and Sublessee thereunder prior to such effective date, respectively, except that in no event shall Landlord be (a) liable for any act or omission by Tenant, (b) subject to any offsets or defenses which Sublessee had or might have against Tenant, (c) bound by any rent or additional rent or other payment paid by Sublessee to Tenant in advance, (d) obligated to honor any right of first opportunity, right of first refusal, or expansion rights granted to Sublessee under the Sublease, or (e) bound by any amendment to the Sublease not consented to by Landlord. Upon expiration of the Sublease pursuant to the provisions of the first sentence of this Paragraph 7, in the event of the failure of Sublessee to vacate the subleased premises as therein provided, Landlord shall be entitled to all the rights and remedies available to a landlord against a tenant holding over after the expiration of a term.
