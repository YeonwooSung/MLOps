Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublessor may enter the Sublease Space without notice for the purpose of any emergency, provided Sublessor shall notify Sublessee as soon as it is reasonably possible after any such emergency entry. No such entry by Sublessor shall be deemed to be an actual or constructive eviction of the Sublessee. The Sublessee shall not install any new lock or bolt on any door without the Sublessor's prior written consent.

14.      SIGNS OR ADVERTISING.

          (a)    Sublessor's Consent.

Any consent so obtained from Sublessor shall be with the understanding and agreement that Sublessee will remove same at the termination of the tenancy herein created and repair any damage or injury to the Premises or Building caused thereby.

16.     SUCCESSORS.

     Subject to the provisions of Sections 10 and 26 hereof, all the covenants, agreements, terms and conditions contained in this Sublease shall apply to and be binding upon the Sublessor and the Sublessee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, marital communities, if any, and assigns.

18.     LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES.

        (a)    Liens. The Sublessee shall keep the Sublease Space and the Building free from any liens arising out of any work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by the Sublessee.

     If by reason of any default or breach hereunder by either of the parties, it becomes necessary to institute a lawsuit or to commence arbitration, or in the event that either party shall commence such an action to interpret or enforce the terms hereof, then the prevailing party in such lawsuit or arbitration shall be entitled to recover, as part of any such judgment or decision, all such amounts as shall be reasonably incurred by such prevailing party for attorneys' fees and any and all such other costs as shall be reasonably and necessarily incurred in pursuit of such lawsuit or arbitration. This provision shall also apply for the benefit of the prevailing party in any appeal taken therefrom.

     The failure of either Sublessor or Sublessee to insist upon strict performance of any of the covenants and agreements of this Sublease or to exercise any option therein conferred in any one or more instances, shall not be construed to be a waiver or relinquishment of any such covenant or agreement or option or of any other covenant or agreement or option, but the same shall be and remain in full force and effect.

22.     CONDEMNATION; CASUALTY.
