MASTER LEASE AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

 

1.1 Subordinate to Master Lease. Except as specifically set forth herein, this Sublease is subject and subordinate to all of the terms and conditions of the lease (the “Lease”) dated as of March 20, 2001, between Sunnyvale VIII Trust, a Maryland business trust (“Master Lessor”) and CacheFlow Inc., a Delaware corporation, now known as Blue Coat Systems, as “Lessee”. The Lease is sometimes referred to herein as the “Master Lease”. Sublessee hereby assumes and agrees to perform the obligations of Lessee under the Master Lease as more particularly set forth hereafter and Sublessor agrees to perform the obligations of Lessee under the Lease to the extent not assumed by Sublesee under this Sublease. Unless otherwise defined, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings as given them in the Master Lease. A copy of the Master Lease is attached hereto as Exhibit “A” and incorporated herein by this reference. With respect to the obligations assumed by Sublessee, Sublessee shall not commit or permit to be committed any act or omission which would violate any term or condition of the Master Lease. With respect to the obligations assumed by Sublessee, Sublessee shall neither do nor permit anything to be done which would cause the Master Lease to be terminated or forfeited by reason of any right of termination or forfeiture reserved or vested in Master Lessor under the Master Lease. Sublessee and Sublessor shall each indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against all liability, judgments, costs, demands, claims, and damages of any kind whatsoever (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and court costs) by reason of any failure on the part of Sublessee to perform any of the obligations of Lessee under the Master Lease which Sublessee and Sublessor are obligated hereunder to perform. In the event of the termination of Sublessor’s interest as Lessee under the Master Lease by Master Lessor, then this Sublease shall terminate automatically upon such termination without any liability of Master Lessor or Sublessor to Sublessee. If there is any right to terminate the Lease on the part of Lessee under the Master Lease, to the extent Master Lessor consents to the assignment by Sublessor of such right to terminate, such right is hereby assigned to Sublessee and only Sublessee, and not Sublessor, may exercise such right. Sublessee represents and warrants to Sublessor that it has read and is familiar with the Master Lease.

 

1.2 Applicable Provisions. All of the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease as they may apply to the Subleased Premises, except those directly contradicted by the terms and conditions contained in this document, and specifically except for Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6(e), 8, 9, 13(a), 21, 29, 30, 31, 36, 41, 42, 43, 51, Exhibits C, and C-1 through C-3, and

Exhibit D are incorporated herein and shall be terms and conditions of this Sublease (with each reference therein to “Landlord” or “Lessor”, “Tenant” or “Lessee” and “Lease” to be deemed to refer to Sublessor, Sublessee, and Sublease, respectively, as appropriate except the following provisions that are incorporated herein, the reference to Landlord or Lessor shall mean Master Lessor only: Sections 19 and 10(e)-(f)), and along with all of the following terms and conditions set forth in this document, shall constitute the complete terms and conditions of this Sublease.

 

1.3 Obligations of Sublessor. The only services or rights to which Sublessee is entitled hereunder from Master Lessor are those to which Sublessor is entitled under the Master Lease, and for all such services and rights Sublessee shall look solely to the Master Lessor under the Master Lease, and the obligations of Sublessor hereunder shall be limited to using its reasonable good faith efforts to obtain the performance by Master Lessor of its obligations. Should Sublessor be unable to obtain any performance by Master Lessor, Sublessor hereby assigns to Sublessee the right to seek to obtain such performance, such right to include legal action against Master Lessor. Sublessor shall have no liability to Sublessee or any other person for damage of any nature whatsoever as a result of the failure of Master Lessor to perform said obligations except for Master Lessor’s termination of the Sublessor’s interest as Lessee under the Master Lease in the event of Sublessor’s breach of the Master Lease, and Sublessee shall indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from any and all claims and liability whatsoever for any such damage (unless such damage is caused by Sublessor’s breach of the Master Lease) including, without limitation, all costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in defending against same. With respect to any obligation of Sublessee to be performed under this Sublease other than a monetary obligation, when the Master Lease grants Sublessor a specific number of days to perform its obligations thereunder, Sublessee shall have two (2) fewer days to perform, provided that if Sublessor is in receipt of a notice of default from Master Lessor, Sublessor agrees to promptly transmit such notice by facsimile to Sublessee, attention: Eric Carlsen at (408) 716-4400 and Sublessee shall have two (2) fewer days than the number of days specified in such notice or the number of days to perform as provided in the Master Lease. With respect to any monetary obligation of Sublessee to be performed under this Sublease, Sublessee shall make the payments on or before the date that such payment is due. With respect to approval required to be obtained from “Landlord” under the Master Lease, such consent must be obtained from Master Lessor and Sublessor and the approval of Sublessor may be withheld if Master Lessor’s consent is not obtained.

Commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor each month during the term of this Sublease, rent in the amount of Twenty Three Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty Seven and 96/100 Dollars ($23,827.96), in advance, on execution hereof for the first month and on or before the first of each month thereafter (“Base Rent”).

SECURITY DEPOSIT

 

4.1 Security Deposit. Upon execution hereof, Sublessee shall deposit with Sublessor the sum of Twenty Three Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty Seven and 96/100 Dollars ($23,827.96) as and for a Security Deposit to secure Sublessee’s full and timely performance of all of its obligations hereunder. If Sublessee fails to pay Rent or any other sums as and when due hereunder, or otherwise defaults and/or fails to perform with respect to any provision of this Sublease, Sublessor may (but shall not be obligated to) use, apply, or retain all or any portion of said deposit for payment of any sum for which Sublessee is obligated or which will compensate Sublessor for any loss or damage which Sublessor may suffer thereby and to which Sublessor may be entitled by law, including, without limitation, any damage that will result in the future through the term of the Sublease, to repair damage to the Subleased Premises, to clean the

 

-3-

Subleased Premises at the end of the term or for any loss or damage caused by the act or omission of Sublessee or Sublessee’s officers, agents, employees, independent contractors or invitees. Sublessee waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1950.7 and all other provisions of law now in force or that become in force after the date of execution of this Sublease that provide that Sublessor may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of Rent, to repair damage caused by Sublessee or to clean the Subleased Premises. Any such use, application, or retention shall not constitute a waiver by Sublessor of its right to enforce its other remedies hereunder, at law, or in equity. If any portion of said deposit is so used, applied, or retained, Sublessee shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of written demand from Sublessor, restore said deposit to its original amount. Sublessee’s failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of this Sublease, and in such event Sublessor may elect, among or in addition to other remedies, to terminate this Sublease. Sublessor shall not be a trustee of such deposit, and shall not be required to keep this deposit separate from its accounts. Sublessor alone shall be entitled to any interest or earnings thereon and Sublessor shall have the free use of same. If Sublessee fully and faithfully performs all of its obligations hereunder, then the deposit, less any amounts used by Sublessor as permitted by this section and not reimbursed by Sublessee, shall be returned to Sublessee (without payment of interest or earnings thereon) within 30 days after the later of (i) expiration or sooner termination of the term hereof, or (ii) Sublessee’s surrender of possession of the Subleased Premises to Sublessor.

 

4.2 Letter of Credit. Two (2) business days after Sublessee’s receipt of a copy of the Consent by Master Lessor to this Sublease, Sublessee shall provide to Sublessor an unconditional, clean, irrevocable Letter of Credit (“Letter of Credit”) in the amount of Thirty Seven Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($37,000) in favor of Sublessor and issued by a bank (which accepts deposits, maintains accounts and will negotiate a letter of credit, and whose deposits are insured by the FDIC) located in the Bay Area and reasonably acceptable to Sublessor (“Issuer”). The Letter of Credit shall (1) be fully transferable by Sublessor to a successor in its interest under this Sublease without payment of transfer fees, (2) permit multiple drawings, and (3) provide that draws, including partial draws, at Sublessor’s election, will be honored upon the delivery to the Issuer a certificate signed by Sublessor, or its authorized agent, that Sublessee is in default under this Sublease and that as a result thereof Sublessor is entitled to make the requested draw pursuant to the terms of the Sublease. The Letter of Credit is to be issued pursuant to ISP98 rather than UCP 500. If Sublessee fails to pay Rent or any other sums as and when due hereunder, or otherwise defaults with respect to any provision of this Sublease, Sublessor may (but shall not be obligated to) use, apply or retain all or any portion of the Letter of Credit for payment of any sum for which Sublessee is obligated or which will compensate Sublessor for any loss or damage which Sublessor may suffer thereby. Any draw or partial draw of the Letter of Credit shall not constitute a waiver by Sublessor of its right to enforce its other remedies hereunder, at law or in equity. If any portion of the Letter of Credit is drawn upon, Sublessee shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of written demand from Sublessor, restore said Letter of Credit to its original amount. The Letter of Credit shall be in effect for the entire term of this Sublease plus sixty (60) days beyond the expiration of the Sublease term. The Letter of Credit will automatically renew each year during the Sublease term unless the beneficiary under the Letter of Credit is given at least thirty (30) days prior notice of a non-renewal by the issuing bank, and Sublessor shall be able to draw on the Letter of Credit in the event of such notice. The parties agree that the provisions of Civil Code Sections 1950.7 and 1951.7 do not apply to the Letter of Credit.

CONDITION OF SUBLEASED PREMISES

 

5.1 Condition of the Subleased Premises. Sublessee acknowledges that as of the Commencement Date, the Subleased Premises, and every part thereof, are in good condition and without need of repair, and Sublessee accepts the Subleased Premises “as is”, Sublessee having made all investigations and tests it has deemed necessary or desirable in order to establish to its own complete satisfaction the condition of the Subleased Premises. Sublessee accepts the Subleased Premises in their condition existing as of the Commencement Date, subject to all applicable zoning, municipal, county and state laws, ordinances, and regulations governing and regulating the use of the Subleased Premises and any covenants or restrictions of record. Sublessee acknowledges that neither Sublessor nor Master Lessor have made any representations or warranties as to the condition of the Subleased Premises or its present or future suitability for Sublessee’s purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublessor shall deliver possession of the Subleased Premises to Sublessee professionally cleaned (which shall consist of vacuuming the carpet and cleaning the windows) and the operating systems in good working condition, including but not limited to HVAC, electrical, elevator, plumbing, and lighting.

 

5.2 Surrender. Sublessee shall keep the Subleased Premises, and every part thereof in at least the same condition it was received from Sublessor, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

6.2 Waiver of Subrogation. With respect to the waiver of subrogation contained in the Master Lease, such waiver shall be deemed to be modified to constitute an agreement by and among Master Lessor, Sublessor and Sublessee (and Master Lessor’s consent to this Sublease shall be deemed to constitute its approval of this modification).

 

-5-

ARTICLE 7

 

USE OF SUBLEASED PREMISES; PARKING; IMPROVEMENTS

 

7.1 Use of Subleased Premises Sublessee shall occupy and use the Subleased Premises only for general office use, research and development and other legal related uses. Sublessee shall not allow the Premises to be used in any manner that is inconsistent or prohibited under Section 6 of the Master Lease.

 

7.2 Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FF&E) Sublessee shall have use of all of the existing wired cubicle systems, desks, chairs, office furniture, conference room furniture, filing cabinets, book shelves, white boards, kitchen appliances, networking systems, and phone handsets and phone system that currently exist in the Subleased Premises throughout the entire term of the Sublease at no additional cost to Sublessee. Sublessor shall provide a list of furnishings, fixtures and equipment and attach it to this Sublease as Exhibit B. Sublessee accepts such FF&E “as is, where is” with no warranty, and at termination of this Sublease shall deliver same back to Sublessor in the same condition as received, ordinary wear and tear excepted; provided, however, that if Sublessee enters into a lease with Master Lessor for the Subleased Premises to continue immediately after the Expiration Date, and if Sublessee is not otherwise in breach of this Sublease, the FF&E shall become the property of Sublessee on the Expiration Date. Sublessee will insure the FF&E against casualty for its replacement value. Sublessor shall cooperate with Sublessee to permit Sublessee to be able to use such FF&E, by providing to Sublessee, to the extent same are available to Sublessor, all manuals, instructions and other documents and information necessary or convenient to the operation of such FF&E, including access codes, passwords and other keys to properly use such FF&E.

 

7.3 Parking. So long as Sublessee is not in default and subject to the rules and regulations imposed from time to time by Master Lessor or Sublessor, Sublessee shall have the right to use all of the parking spaces associated with the Premises as specified in the Master Lease.

 

ARTICLE 8

 

ASSIGNMENT, SUBLETTING & ENCUMBRANCE

 

8.1 Consent Required. Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease or any interest therein nor shall Sublessee sublet, license, encumber or permit the Subleased Premises or any part thereof to be used or occupied by others, without Sublessor’s and Master Lessor’s prior written consent. Sublessor’s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld provided, however, Sublessor’s withholding of consent shall in all events be deemed reasonable if for any reason Master Lessor’s consent is not obtained. The consent by Sublessor and Master Lessor to any assignment or subletting shall not waive the need for Sublessee (and Sublessee’s assignee or subtenant) to obtain the consent of Sublessor and Master Lessor to any different or further assignment or subletting. All Conditions and Standards set forth in the Master Lease regarding assignments and subletting shall apply, and to the extent there is any Bonus Rents (Rent paid by such Assignee or SubSublessee in excess of Rent paid by Sublessee hereunder), the Bonus Rent shall first be split per the Master Lease and any Bonus Rent to go to Sublessee shall be split 50/50 with Sublessor to be paid to Sublessor within five (5) days of receipt by Sublessee.

 

-6-

8.2 Form of Document. Every assignment, agreement, or sublease shall (i) recite that it is and shall be subject and subordinate to the provisions of this Sublease, that the assignee or subtenant assumes Sublessee’s obligation hereunder, that the termination of this Sublease shall at Sublessor’s sole election, constitute a termination of every such assignment or sublease, and (ii) contain such other terms and conditions as shall be reasonably requested or provided by Sublessor’s attorneys.

 

8.3 No Release of Sublessee. Regardless of Sublessor’s consent, no subletting or assignment shall release Sublessee of Sublessee’s obligation or alter the primary liability of Sublessee to pay the Rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Sublessee hereunder. The acceptance of Rent by Sublessor from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Sublessor of any provision hereof. In the event of default by any assignee, subtenant or any other successor of Sublessee, in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Sublessor may proceed directly against Sublessee without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such assignee, subtenant or successor.

 

8.4 Default. An involuntary assignment shall constitute a default and Sublessor shall have the right to elect to terminate this Sublease, in which case this Sublease shall not be treated as an asset of Sublessee.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

DEFAULT

 

9.1 Default Described. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a material breach of this Sublease and a default by Sublessee: (i) failure to pay Rent or any other amount within three (3) business days after due; (ii) all those items of default set forth in the Master Lease which remain uncured after the cure period provided in the Master Lease; or (iii) Sublessee’s failure to perform timely and subject to any cure periods any other material provision of this Sublease or the Master Lease as incorporated herein.

 

9.2 Sublessor’s Remedies. Sublessor shall have the remedies set forth in the Master Lease as if Sublessor is Master Lessor. These remedies are not exclusive; they are cumulative and in addition to any remedies now or later allowed by law.

 

9.3 Sublessee’s Right to Possession Not Terminated. Sublessor has the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (lessor may continue lease in effect after lessee’s breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due, if lessee has right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations). Sublessor may continue this Sublease in full force and effect, and Sublessor shall have the right to collect rent and other sums when due. During the period Sublessee is in default, Sublessor may enter the Subleased Premises and relet them, or any part of them, to third parties for Sublessee’s account and alter or install locks and other security devices at the Subleased Premises. Sublessee shall be liable immediately to Sublessor for all costs Sublessor incurs and as permitted by law in reletting the Subleased

 

-7-

Premises, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, brokers’ commissions, expenses of remodeling the Subleased Premises required by the reletting, and like costs. Reletting may be for a period equal to, shorter or longer than the remaining term of this Sublease and rent received by Sublessor shall be applied to (i) first, any indebtedness from Sublessee to Sublessor other than rent due from Sublessee; (ii) second, all costs incurred by Sublessor in reletting, including, without limitation, brokers’ fees or commissions and attorneys fees, the cost of removing and storing the property of Sublessee or any other occupant, and the costs of repairing, altering, maintaining, remodeling or otherwise putting the Subleased Premises into condition acceptable to a new Sublessee or Sublessees; (iii) third, rent due and unpaid under this Sublease. After deducting the payments referred to in this subsection 9.3, any sum remaining from the rent Sublessor receives from reletting shall be held by Sublessor and applied in payment of future rent and other amounts as rent and such amounts become due under this Sublease. In no event shall Sublessee be entitled to any excess rent received by Sublessor.

 

9.4 All Sums Due and Payable as Rent. Sublessee shall also pay without notice, or where notice is required under this Sublease, immediately upon demand without any abatement, deduction, or setoff, as additional rent all sums, impositions, costs, expenses, and other payments which Sublessee in any of the provisions of this Sublease assumes or agrees to pay, and, in case of any nonpayment thereof, Sublessor shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies, all the rights and remedies provided for in this Sublease or by law in the case of nonpayment of rent.

 

9.5 No Waiver. Sublessor may accept Sublessee’s payments of less than full amount of rent due without waiving any rights under the Sublease, including rights under a previously served notice of default. So long as there is a default hereunder, no payment by Sublessee or receipt by Sublessor of a lesser amount than any installment of rent due or other sums shall be deemed as other than a payment on account of the amount due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction; and Sublessor may accept such check or payment without prejudice of Sublessor’s right to recover the balance of such rent or other sum or pursue any other remedy provided in this Sublease, at law or in equity. If Sublessor accepts payments after serving a notice of default, Sublessor may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Sublessee any further notice or demand. Furthermore, the Sublessor’s acceptance of rent from Sublessee when the Sublessee is holding over without express written consent does not convert Sublessee’s tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month-to-month tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Sublease shall be implied by any failure of Sublessor to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision, even if that violation continues or is repeated. Any waiver by Sublessor of any provision of this Sublease must be in writing. Such waiver shall affect only the provisions specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Sublessor shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof by Sublessor. No act or conduct of Sublessor, including, without limitation the acceptance of keys to the Subleased Premises shall constitute acceptance or the surrender of the Subleased Premises by Sublessee before the Expiration Date. Only written notice from Sublessor to Sublessee of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance or surrender of the Subleased Premises. Sublessor’s consent to or approval of any act by Sublessee which requires Sublessor’s consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary Sublessor’s consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Sublessee.

 

-8-

9.6 Sublessor Default. For purposes of this Sublease, Sublessor shall not be deemed in default hereunder unless and until Sublessee shall first deliver to Sublessor written notice of such default, and Sublessor shall fail to promptly cure said default or to commence to cure said default and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion

 

9.7 Notice of Event of Default under Master Lease. Sublessor shall notify Sublessee of any Event of Default under the Master Lease, or of any other event of which Sublessor has actual knowledge which will impair Sublessee’s ability to conduct its normal business at the Subleased Premises, as soon as reasonably practicable following Sublessor’s receipt of notice from Master Lessor of an Event of Default or Sublessor’s actual knowledge of such impairment.

 

ARTICLE 10

 

CONSENT OF MASTER LESSOR

Neither the Sublease nor this consent shall release or discharge Tenant from any liability under the Master Lease and Tenant shall remain liable and responsible for the full performance and observance of all of the provisions, covenants, and conditions set forth in the Master Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed and observed. The breach or violation of any provision of the Master Lease by Subtenant shall constitute a default by Tenant in fulfilling such provision and any breach of the Master Lease by either Tenant or Subtenant shall entitled Landlord to all the rights and remedies provided in the Master Lease in the event of a breach, and any other available remedy, against both Tenant and Subtenant.

 

2. This consent shall not be construed as approval or consent to any provision(s) of the Sublease which may conflict with or be interpreted to restrict Landlord’s rights or Tenant’s obligations under the Master Lease, or to expand upon Tenant’s rights or Landlord’s obligations under the Master Lease, and Landlord shall not be bound or estopped in any way by the provisions of the Sublease, including any provision which purports to bind Landlord in any way contrary to the terms of the Master Lease; provided, that as set forth in Section 6.2 Waiver of Subrogation, the waiver of subrogation set forth in the Master Lease shall apply among Landlord, Tenant and Subtenant. This consent shall not create in Subtenant, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, any rights except as specifically set forth herein. All communications with Landlord will be recognized by Landlord only if made by Tenant, not Subtenant, including without limitations requests for approvals as required under the Master Lease. Tenant hereby appoints Subtenant as Tenant’s agent for the purpose of communicating with Landlord with regard to matters arising in the ordinary course of tenancy (e.g. parking matters, after hours HVAC requirements, excess janitorial services, ordinary repairs and maintenance), and notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, Landlord agrees to recognize Subtenant as Tenant’s agent with respect to such matters and to communicate with Subtenant, as agent for Tenant, with respect to such matters. Tenant hereby agrees that Landlord may rely on Subtenant’s authority as Tenant’s agent with respect to any matter which may be reasonably understood to fall within the foregoing description of Subtenant authority.
