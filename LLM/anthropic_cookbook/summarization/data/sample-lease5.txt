Exhibit 10.4

 

LANDLORD’S CONSENT TO SUBLEASE

 

This Agreement is made as of September 22, 2005, among (“Landlord”), Teutsch Partners, Conoco Phillips Company, a Delaware corporation (“Tenant”), and Zymogenetics, (“Subtenant”).

 

RECITALS:

 

A. Pursuant to a Lease dated as of September 19, 2003 (the “Lease”), between Landlord and Tenant, Tenant is leasing from Landlord certain premises (the “Premises”) situated on the 2nd floor of the building (the “Building”) currently known as the 1144 Eastlake Building, located at 1144 Eastlake Ave. East, Seattle WA.

 

B. Pursuant to a Sublease in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A (the “Sublease”), Tenant has agreed to sublease to Subtenant a portion of the Premises, as more particularly described in the Sublease.

 

C. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Tenant must obtain the prior written consent of Landlord to any sublease of all or any portion of the Premises. Landlord is prepared to consent to the Sublease on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT:

 

Landlord hereby consents to the Sublease, subject to the following terms, covenants and agreements of the parties, and in consideration of such consent, Tenant and Subtenant agrees as follows:

 

1. Neither the Sublease nor this Agreement shall be construed to relieve Tenant of any liabilities or obligations whatsoever under the lease. Tenant shall continue to be fully and primarily liable for the full performance of all obligations of the tenant under the Lease.

 

2. Subtenant and Tenant acknowledge and agree the Sublease and all of Subtenant’s rights thereunder shall be subject and subordinated in all respects to the Lease. If the Lease terminates or is terminated prior to the expiration of the term of the Sublease, the Sublease also shall terminate; provided, however, at Landlord’s sole option, following a termination of the Lease, the Sublease shall remain in full force and effect, in which event Subtenant shall attorn to Landlord and recognize Landlord as Subtenant’s landlord under the Sublease, upon the terms and conditions and at the rental rate specified in the Sublease, and for the then remaining term of the Sublease, except Landlord shall not be bound by any provision of the Sublease which in any way increases Landlord’s duties, obligations or liabilities to Subtenant beyond those owed to tenant under the Lease. Subtenant shall execute and deliver at any time and from time to time upon the request of landlord, any instruments which may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such attornment. Landlord shall not in any event (i) be liable to Subtenant for any act, omission or breach of the Sublease by Tenant, (ii) be subject to any offsets or defenses which Subtenant might have against Tenant, (iii) be bound by any rent or additional rent which Subtenant might have paid in advance to Tenant, or (iv) be bound to honor any rights of Subtenant in and to any

security or other deposits paid by Subtenant pursuant to the Lease except to the extent Tenant has turned over such security or other deposits to Landlord. If Tenant is in default under the terms of the Lease, Landlord shall have the right to take all actions available to Landlord under the Lease and by law, including but not limited to the right to commence an unlawful detainer action against Tenant and Subtenant.

 

3. Whenever the Lease gives Landlord a right of involvement, such as a right to approve, consent, cooperate or decide, Landlord shall have such right with respect to both Tenant and Subtenant. If Landlord and Tenant disagree over any decision requiring both of their consents or approvals, Landlord’s decision shall control. For example, the Lease requires Landlord’s prior consent to any alterations or additions to the Premises. If Subtenant desires to make alterations or additions to the Premises, it must obtain the prior consent of both Landlord and Tenant.

 

4. Tenant will pay Landlord’s attorneys’ fees in reviewing the Sublease and preparing this Agreement, not to exceed $1,500.00.

 

5. The indemnity and other agreements contained in the Sublease (or incorporated therein by reference) shall apply with equal force and effect between Subtenant and Landlord (with Subtenant indemnifying Landlord in accordance with the terms of the Sublease), and Landlord shall be named as an additional insured on any insurance maintained by Subtenant under the Sublease.

 

6. This Agreement shall not relieve Tenant of its obligation to obtain Landlord’s consent to (a) any further sublease of all or part of the Premises, or (b) any assignment of the Lease; nor shall the Sublease or this Agreement be construed as conferring upon Subtenant any right to further sublease the Premises or assign its rights under the Sublease in either case without Landlord’s consent.

 

7. A failure by Tenant or Subtenant to comply with any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall constitute a default under the Lease. If any party to this Agreement commences an action or other legal proceeding to enforce performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof or of the Lease, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall, in addition to such other relief as it may obtain, be entitled to recover from the other parties all of its costs incurred, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in any such action or proceeding or any appeal from any order, award or judgment therein.

 

8. In addition to Landlord’s rights under this Agreement, the Lease, at law or in equity, if Tenant is in default under any of the terms or provisions of the Lease, Landlord may elect to receive directly from Subtenant all sums due or payable to Tenant by Subtenant pursuant to the Sublease, and upon receipt of written notice from Landlord to do so, Subtenant shall thereafter pay Landlord any sums becoming due or payable under the Sublease. Tenant hereby consents to such direct payment and authorizes and directs Subtenant to comply with any notice given by Landlord to Subtenant pursuant to the proceeding sentence. Neither the service of such written notice nor the receipt and acceptance of such direct payments shall cause Landlord to be deemed to have assumed any of Tenant’s duties, obligations and/or liabilities to Subtenant under the Sublease, nor shall such event impose upon the Landlord the duty or obligation to accept an attornment by Subtenant following a termination of the Lease.

9. Any options to extend the Lease, rights of first refusal to lease additional space or right to expand the Premises may not be exercised by or for the benefit of Subtenant.

 

10. Subtenant and Tenant shall not amend or modify the Sublease without Landlord’s prior written consent.

 

11. This Agreement shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, subject, however, to all restrictions on assignment and subletting contained in the Lease or in this Agreement. In the event of any litigation or other legal proceeding between the parties to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the unsuccessful party or parties shall pay to the prevailing party or parties, all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the prevailing party or parties, whether such fees and expenses are incurred in trial court, on appeal, in bankruptcy court or in any other legal proceeding.

SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS AGREEMENT (hereinafter referred to as the “Sublease”) is made and entered into as of the          day of September 2005, between ConocoPhillips Company, a Delaware corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “Sublessor”) and ZymoGenetics, Inc., a Washington corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “Sublessee”).

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Sublessor desires to sublease its interest in a portion of the “Premises”, as defined in the Prime Lease (as such term is hereinafter defined), to Sublessee; and

 

WHEREAS, Sublessee desires to sublease the Sublease Premises from Sublessor upon the terms and conditions contained herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged by said parties, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

 

1. Sublease Premises. Sublessor hereby leases to Sublessee and Sublessee hereby leases from Sublessor approximately 7,128 rentable square feet of space on the 2nd floor (currently identified as Suite 201) of 1144 Eastlake Building (the “Building”) which is located at 1144 Eastlake Avenue E, Seattle, Washington 98109, as shown on the floor plan, less the area shown hatched in black, attached hereto as Exhibit “A” and made a part hereof (the “Sublease Premises”) for a term of 37 months, commencing on the later of October 1, 2005 or the date Sublessor delivers the Sublease Premises to Sublessee (the “Commencement Date”)-and ending at 11:59 p.m. on October 31, 2008, regardless of the actual Commencement Date, (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Sublease Term”), unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, and subject to the contingencies specified in Article 14 hereof. Sublessee agrees that the Sublease Commencement Date shall be the later of October 1, 2005, or the date of actual delivery of the Sublease Premises to Sublessee. Sublessor and Sublessee further agree that if the Commencement Date is later than October 1, 2005, Sublessee’s payment of Monthly Rental and Additional Rent in the amounts applicable for the specific period of time on the actual Commencement Date as reflected in the rent schedule shown below in Article 2(a) and Article 2(c) shall be payable on or before the actual date of commencement. Upon the request of either party or Prime Lessor, Sublessor and Sublessee shall execute a Commencement Date Certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit “C.”

 

(b) Late or Early Delivery. In the event Sublessor is unable to deliver possession of the Premises at the commencement of the term, Sublessor shall not be liable for any damage caused thereby, nor shall this Sublease be void or voidable but Sublessee shall not be liable for rent until such time as Sublessor offers to deliver possession of the Premises to Sublessee, but the term hereof shall not be extended by such delay. If Sublessee, with Sublessor’s and Prime Lessor’s consents, takes possession prior to the commencement of the term, Sublessee shall do so subject to all the covenants and conditions hereof except for the payment of Monthly Rent and Additional Rent which shall be free from such prior date to the commencement of the term until October 1, 2005 which Monthly Rent and Additional Rent thereafter shall be as reflected in the rent schedule shown below in Article 2.

 

2. Rent; Security Deposit; Parking.

 

(a) Sublessee agrees to pay to Sublessor at the address Sublessor designates herein, or at such other place as Sublessor may designate in writing, without demand, counterclaim, deduction or setoff, in legal tender, base rental for the Sublease Term payable in monthly base rental installments (“Monthly Rental”) as follows:

 

Date/Term

  	Monthly Installment
of Base Rent
  	Yearly Rental Rate
Per Rentable Square Foot
10-01-05 to 11-30-05

  	$	0.00	  	$	0.00
12-01-05 to 10-31-06

  	$	13,929.30	  	$	23.45
11-01-06 to 10-31-07

  	$	14,523.30	  	$	24.45
11-01-07 to 10-31-08

  	$	15,117.30	  	$	25.45
Sublessee shall pay the Monthly Rental and any other sum due hereunder as rent, whether or not designated as rent, to ConocoPhillips Company, ATTN: Tax ID 91-1144498, 21064 Network Place, Chicago, IL 60673-1210. The reference “Tax ID 91-1144498” shall to be inserted on all rental checks. Sublessee shall pay the Monthly Rental in advance not later than the 1st day of every month during the Sublease Term. Notwithstanding the above, concurrently with its execution hereof, Sublessee has paid to Sublessor the first month’s rent due under this Sublease.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sublessee receives a notice from the Prime Lessor that the Sublessor has defaulted on its monetary obligations under the Prime Lease, then from and after that date Sublessee receives such notice, regardless of any subsequent cure of such default, Sublessee shall have the right but not the obligation to deliver all subsequent Monthly Rental and Additional Rent accruing hereunder directly to the Prime Lessor for Sublessor’s account (or to continue to pay Sublessor directly).

 

(b) The Base Year for the Sublease shall be 2005.

 

(c) Sublessee shall pay monthly as “Additional Rent” the Sublessee’s Pro Rata Share of Expenses, Taxes and Insurance, as defined in Article 4.2 of the Prime Lease that exceeds the Base Year Operating Costs as defined therein. The Sublessee’s Pro Rata Share is estimated in Article 1.4 of the Prime Lease as 8.92% or as modified by the Prime Lessor. Any cap (currently at 5%) on such expenses stated in the Prime Lease’s paragraph 4.2 shall apply to this Sublease as well.

 

(d) Sublessor and Sublessee agree that there shall be no initial security deposit required. Sublessor reserves the right to demand, and Sublessee agrees to pay, a deposit of $20,000 should Sublessee default per the terms of Article 10 below, if such default is not cured within the applicable notice and cure period. Upon notice to Sublessee by Sublessor, the following language shall be added language to the Sublease:

 

“Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor $20,000.00 as security for Sublessee’s payment of Monthly Rental and performance of its other obligations under this Sublease and any renewals or extensions of this Sublease. If Sublessee defaults in its payment of Monthly Rental or performance of its other obligations under this Sublease, Sublessor may use all or part of the security deposit for the payment of Monthly Rental or any other amount in default, or for the payment of any other amount that Sublessor may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of Sublessee’s default, or for the payment to Sublessor of any other loss or damage that Sublessor may suffer by reason of Sublessee’s default. If Sublessor so uses any portion of the security deposit, Sublessee will restore the security deposit to its original amount within five (5) days after written demand from Sublessor. Sublessor will not be required to keep the security deposit separate for its own funds and Sublessee will not be entitled to interest on the security deposit. The security deposit will not be a limitation on Sublessor’s damages or other rights under this Sublease, or a payment of liquidated damages, or an advance payment of the Monthly Rental. Upon expiration of the Sublease Term or earlier termination of this Sublease the security deposit shall be returned to Sublessee within a reasonable amount of time after such termination, reduced by such amounts as may be required by Sublessor to remedy defaults on the part of Sublessee in the payment of Monthly Rental, to repair damage to the Sublease Premises and the Building caused by Sublessee, its agents, employees, invitees and licensees and to clean the Sublease Premises.”

 

(e) At no additional charge to Sublessee, Sublessee shall be entitled to the use, on a non-exclusive basis, fourteen (14) parking stalls in the Building and the non-exclusive use of three (3) additional parking stalls located either in the Building or in surface parking lots in the vicinity of the Building. Use of such parking stalls shall be upon such terms and conditions and subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as

Prime Lessor or Sublessor may publish from time to time and otherwise strictly in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Article 30 of the Prime Lease (but without any requirement that Sublessee pay the amounts stated therein for such stalls) as such amounts are included in the Monthly Rental as stated in Article 2 above.

 

3. Subordinate to Prime Lease, Sublessor Covenants.

 

(a) That certain so-called Office Lease entered into as of the 19th day of September, 2003 by and between Sublessor, as tenant therein, and 1144 Eastlake LLC, as landlord therein (“Prime Lessor”), pursuant to which Sublessor leases and occupies approximately 7,128 rentable square feet of space on the 2nd floor of the Building (the “Premises”), is herein referred to as the “Prime Lease”. The Sublease Premises is comprised of the entire Premises. A copy of the Prime Lease, including all amendments and exhibits thereto is attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and made a part hereof. Sublessee acknowledges that it is familiar with the terms of the Prime Lease. In the event of any termination of the Prime Lease, this Sublease shall automatically terminate and Sublessor shall have no further liability to Sublessee. Except as may be inconsistent with the terms hereof, and subject to Sublessor performing its covenants stated in Article 3(b) below, all the terms, covenants, restrictions and conditions in the Prime Lease contained as of the date of this Sublease, shall be applicable to this Sublease with the same force and effect as if the Sublessor were the “lessor” under the Prime Lease (except with respect to Prime Lessor’s obligations to provide services under the Prime Lease, as to which Section 6 hereof shall prevail) and Sublessee were the “lessee” thereunder; and in the case of any breach hereof by Sublessee, Sublessor shall have all the rights against Sublessee as would be available to Prime Lessor against Sublessor as “lessee” under the Prime Lease. This Sublease is in all respects subject to and subordinate to the terms and conditions of the Prime Lease. Except as expressly contradicted by the terms of this Sublease, Sublessee agrees to be bound by all of the covenants, restrictions, terms and conditions of the Prime Lease in its use and occupancy of the Sublease Premises, and Sublessee covenants and agrees to perform all obligations of Sublessor arising under the Prime Lease during the term of this Sublease, and to refrain from violating or breaching any of the terms, covenants, restrictions and conditions of the Prime Lease.

 

(b) Sublessor hereby covenants and agrees for the Sublessee’s benefit as follows:

 

(i) To timely pay all Base Rent, Additional Rent and any other amounts due to Prime Lessor or otherwise under the Prime Lease;

 

(ii) Sublessor hereby waives irrevocably its Extension Rights under the Prime Lease at Article 1.5(c), covenants not to exercise such rights and agrees that the Prime Lessor may rely upon its statement in this subsection as a complete waiver;

 

(iii) Not to voluntarily cause, permit or consent to the termination or alternation of the Prime Lease, without first obtaining Sublessee’s consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(iv) Sublessee shall and may peacefully have, hold and enjoy the Sublease Premises free from any person claiming a right thereto through Sublessor, subject to the terms of this Sublease and the Prime Lease, provided Sublessee pays the Monthly Rental and Additional Rent and fully performs all of its covenants and agreements;

 

(v) To deliver, as soon as practicable via facsimile, copies of all notices it receives from the Prime Lessor relating to the Sublease Premises, this Sublease or otherwise under the Prime Lease; and

 

(vi) Upon request by Sublessee, if reasonably determined necessary by Sublessee to establish privity of contract or other standing to compel Prime Lessor to perform, Sublessor will agree join as a co-plaintiff or co-petitioner with Sublessee in any action against Prime Lessor concerning a breach of Prime Lessor’s obligations under the Prime Lease; provided, however, that as a condition concurrent with Sublessor’s agreement to join in such action, Sublessee agrees (A) to reimburse Sublessor

immediately upon demand as Additional Rent, all of Sublessor’s expenses, including attorney’s fees, in connection with such action; (B) that by virtue of making a request for joinder, Sublessee has agreed to indemnify, defend and hold Sublessor harmless, for any of Sublessor’s claims, losses, costs, expenses and/or damages arising from or relating to Sublessee’s actions under this Subsection 3(b)(vi), including, but not limited to attorney’s fees and costs.

 

4. Insurance. Sublessee shall maintain at all times during the term of this Sublease, at its sole expense, comprehensive general liability insurance against claims for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage occurring on, in or about the Sublease Premises in the amount of $10,000,000 per occurrence and shall name Sublessor and Prime Lessor as additional insureds. Sublessee shall also maintain, at its sole expense, physical damage insurance, on all of its personal property, including removable trade fixtures, located in the Sublease Premises and on all additions and leasehold improvements in the Sublease Premises. Such insurance shall be written on an “all risks” of physical loss or damage basis, for the full replacement cost value new without deduction for depreciation of the covered items and in amounts that meet any coinsurance clauses of the policies of insurance and shall include a vandalism and malicious mischief endorsement, sprinkler leakage coverage and earthquake sprinkler leakage coverage. All such insurance policies shall comply with all requirements of the Prime Lease, and shall be maintained with an insurance company licensed in the State of Washington with a Best’s rating of “A-VIII” or better in Best’s Insurance Guide. Sublessee shall deliver the certificate(s) of all such insurance prior to the commencement date of this Sublease and upon request, at any time thereafter. The insurance certificates shall provide that such insurance shall not be cancelled or materially adversely amended without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Sublessor and Prime Lessor. Sublessee agrees to have any and all physical damage coverage and all material damage insurance that will either include in the policy a right of Sublessee to waive subrogation without affecting the insureds’ rights to recover under the policy, or endorsed with the following subrogation clause: “This insurance shall not be invalidated should the insurer waive in writing prior to a loss any or all right of recovery against any party for loss occurring to the property described herein.” Sublessee hereby expressly waives all rights of recovery which it might otherwise have against Sublessor or Prime Lessor, for any loss or damage to personal property to the extent that such loss is covered, or would be covered by the insurance, required by this Article 4, if it were in effect. Sublessee shall further cause its insurers to waive any right of subrogation that they might otherwise have against Sublessor or Prime Lessor. Should premiums paid by the Sublessor or Prime Lessor increase due to Sublessee’s operations, the contents within the Sublease Premises or improvements made to the Sublease Premises, Sublessee shall promptly pay the increased amount of the premium upon request to Sublessor or Prime Lessor, respectively.

 

5. “As Is” Condition; Use; Alterations. Sublessee shall assume all of Sublessor’s obligations in Article 8 of the Prime Lease and shall take the Sublease Premises on an “as is” basis, subject to Sublessor delivering the Sublease Premises with the equipment listed on attached Exhibit “DD” (the “Sublease Premises FF&E”). As used herein “as is” means the condition the Sublease Premises and the Sublease Premises FF&E are in as of the execution date of this Sublease, subject to ordinary wear and tear. Sublessee’s taking possession of any portion of the Sublease Premises with such Sublease Premises FF&E shall be conclusive evidence against Sublessee that such portion of the Sublease Premises was in a good order and satisfactory condition when Sublessee took possession. No promise of Sublessor to alter, remodel, repair or improve the Sublease Premises and no representation respecting the condition of the Sublease Premises or the Building or any portion thereof have been made by Sublessor to Sublessee except as otherwise provided above in this Article 5. SUBLESSOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, AND SUBLESSEE HEREBY WAIVES, ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR TYPE WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBLEASED PREMISES, THE SUBLEASE PREMISES FF&E, THE BUILDING, OR ANY IMPROVEMENTS LOCATED THEREON, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BY WAY OF DESCRIPTION BUT NOT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITION OR SAFETY. SUBLESSEE EXPRESSLY

AGREES THAT NEITHER SUBLESSOR, NOR ANYONE ACTING FOR OR ON BEHALF OF THE SUBLESSOR, HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR PROMISE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO SUBLESSEE CONCERNING THE QUALITY, VALUE, PHYSICAL ASPECTS OR CONDITIONS OF THE SUBLEASED PREMISES, THE SUBLEASE PREMISES FF&E, THE BUILDING OR ANY IMPROVEMENTS LOCATED THEREON, OR ANY OTHER MATTER WITH RESPECT THERETO, AND THAT SUBLESSEE HAS NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR PROMISE. SUBLESSEE AGREES THAT IT HAS MADE A PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE SUBLEASED PREMISES, THE SUBLEASE PREMISES FF&E, THE BUILDING, AND ANY BUILDINGS AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS LOCATED THEREON AND IS IN ALL RESPECTS SATISFIED WITH THE CONDITION AND FITNESS THEREOF AND ACCEPTS THE SAME “AS IS”, “WHERE IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS, IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT DISCLAIMERS OF THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION ARE “CONSPICUOUS” DISCLAIMERS FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW, RULE OR ORDER. SUBLESSOR DOES NOT WARRANT EITHER EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY THE CONDITION OR FITNESS OF THE PROPERTY SUBLEASED HEREUNDER, ANY SUCH WARRANTY BEING HEREBY EXPRESSLY NEGATIVED. The Sublease Premises shall be used and occupied by Sublessee solely for the purpose of general office uses and for no other purpose. Sublessee covenants and agrees that it will, at its expense, comply with all laws, ordinances, orders, directions, requirements, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities (including federal, state, county and municipal authorities), now in force or which may hereafter be in force, which shall impose any duty upon Prime Lessor, Sublessor or Sublessee with respect to the use, occupancy or alteration of the Sublease Premises and of all insurance bodies applicable to the Sublease Premises and to the Sublessee’s use or occupancy thereof. Sublessee shall not use or permit the use of the Sublease Premises in any manner that will tend to create waste or a nuisance or to disturb other tenants of the Building or that will violate any of the terms or provisions of the Prime Lease.

 

Any alterations, additions or improvements desired by Sublessee shall be at Sublessee’s sole cost and expense and must be first approved in writing by Sublessor and Prime Lessor, with the requirements for approvals, the standards and timetables therefore as set forth and pursuant to the provisions stated in the Prime Lease at Article 9.3 therein, but including both Sublessor and Prime Lessor as approving parties, when applicable. Any such additions, alterations or modifications shall be carried out by Sublessee, at its own expense, in accordance with the provisions of the Prime Lease. Sublessee shall indemnify and hold harmless Sublessor and Prime Lessor from any and all costs, expenses, claims or liabilities, incurred in connection with the installation by Sublessee of any additions, alterations or modifications to or of the Sublease Premises, except to the extent done at the direction of the Sublessor or Prime Lessor.

 

6. Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the only services or rights to which Sublessee is entitled hereunder are those to which Sublessor is entitled to as “lessee” under the Prime Lease and that for all such services and rights Sublessee will look to Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease. Except as expressly setforth in Article 3(b) above, nothing contained in this Sublease shall in any way obligate Sublessor to perform any act required to be performed by the Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease, nor shall Sublessor incur any liability of Sublessee by virtue of the Prime Lessor’s failure to perform any act required of it or Prime Lessor’s failure to give any consent under the Prime Lease. Sublessor agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause Prime Lessor to provide the services required of Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease.

 

7. No Acts. Sublessee shall neither do nor permit anything to be done which would cause the Prime Lease to be terminated or forfeited or any claims to accrue to the benefit of Prime Lessor by reasons of any right of termination or forfeiture reserved or vested in Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease, or any rights to damages accruing to or for the benefit of Prime Lessor under the Prime Lease, and Sublessee shall indemnify and hold Sublessor harmless from and against all loss, cost, damage or expense, including,

but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and court costs, incurred by Sublessor by reason of any default on the part of Sublessee by reason of which the Prime Lease may be terminated or forfeited, or any claim shall accrue to the benefit of or for Sublessor under the Prime Lease. Sublessee agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold Sublessor harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments, decrees, orders, liabilities, or expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements arising out of or on account of any damage or injuries, including wrongful death sustained or claimed to have been sustained to any person or property in or upon the Sublease Premises by any person whatsoever unless the same shall result directly and exclusively from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of Sublessor. Sublessor shall not be liable for damage to person or property sustained by Sublessee or any other person, however such damage may have been caused, except to the extent resulting from the Sublessor’s gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

 

8. Surrender. Upon the termination or expiration of this Sublease at any time and for any reason, Sublessee will immediately quit and peacefully surrender possession of the Sublease Premises and Sublessee agrees to return the Sublease Premises in the same condition as they existed at the date of Sublessee’s occupancy, except for ordinary wear and tear and except for alterations and improvements approved by Sublessor and Prime Lessor, and Sublessee shall remove all of its personal property therefrom. If Sublessee remains in possession of the Sublease Premises after the end of the term of this Sublease with the prior consent of Sublessor, and the Prime Lease is still in effect, then Sublessee will occupy the Sublease Premises as a tenant from month to month, subject to all conditions, provisions and obligations of this Sublease in effect on the last day of the term. If Sublessee remains in possession of the Sublease Premises after the end of the term of this Sublease without the consent of Sublessor, and the Prime Lease is still in effect, then Sublessee shall indemnify Sublessor against all claims, losses, costs, expenses, and damages arising therefrom.

 

9. No Assignment. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease or any interest hereunder or further sublet all or any part of the Sublease Premises, or permit the use of the Sublease Premises by any party other than Sublessee and the employees of Sublessee, without the prior written consent of Sublessor and Prime Lessor in each instance, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of Article 12 of the Prime Lease. Sublessee shall not permit Sublessee’s interest in this Sublease to be vested in any third party by operation of law or otherwise. In the event such consent is obtained, any rents or other consideration received under any such proposed sublease which exceed the rent as defined in this Sublease or any consideration for an assignment shall be paid to Sublessor as and when received by Sublessee. For purposes of this Article 9, an assignment of this Sublease shall be deemed to occur upon any change in the ownership of Sublessee as described in Article 12 of the Prime Lease, provided however that Sublessee shall be permitted to transfer this Sublease or its interest in the Sublease Premises without obtaining Sublessor or Prime Lessor’s consent for those transfers described in the Prime Lease’s Article 12.4.

 

10. Default. The following events shall be deemed to be events of default by Sublessee under this Sublease:

 

(a) Sublessee shall fail to pay any installment of rent hereby reserved as and when the same shall become due if the failure continues for three (3) business days after written notice to Sublessee (“Monetary Default). Sublessor may, at its sole option, invoke the provisions of Article 2(d) above regardless or whether or not a Monetary Default is cured;

 

(b) Sublessee shall fail (other than a Monetary Default) to comply with any term, provision or covenant of the Prime Lease or this Sublease and shall not cure such failure within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Sublessee. However, if Sublessee’s failure to comply cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days, Sublessee shall be allowed additional time as is reasonably necessary to cure the failure so long as: (1) Sublessee commences to cure the failure within thirty (30) days, and (2) Sublessee diligently pursues a course of action that will cure the failure and bring

Tenant may not exercise its Extension Right if it is then in default beyond any applicable cure period or if it has ever been in default beyond any applicable cure period more than two (2) times in any twelve (12) month period. Tenant may exercise its Extension Right by delivering written notice thereof to Landlord not later than nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the initial term. In the Extended Term, all terms and conditions of this Lease shall apply except (i) there shall be no additional renewal terms; (ii) the Base Monthly Rent for the Extended Term shall be the then prevailing Fair Market Rent, provided that in no event shall the Base Monthly Rent for the Extended Term be less than the Base Monthly Rent for the last month of the initial term; (iii) parking rates during the Extended Term shall be at the than-prevailing rates for the Building; and (iv) the Base Year and Base Year Operating Expenses shall be reset to the calendar year in which falls the first day of the Extended Term.

 

Extension Rights shall apply to all of the Premises than under lease to Tenant. Tenant’s Extension Right is personal and may not be exercised by any assignee or sublessee other than an affiliate of Tenant or a successor by merger or consolidation.

 

The term “Fair Market Rent” for the purposes of this Lease shall mean the annual amount per rentable square foot that Landlord has accepted in current, new comparable transactions in the Building for comparable space, for a comparable period of time, with improvements comparable to those existing in the Premises on the date Tenant exercises its Extension Right (or with such restoration as Tenant would be required to make upon termination of the Lease, if such would increase the Fair Market Rent) from non-expansion, non-renewal and non-equity tenants, or if there are not a sufficient number of current comparable transactions in the Building, what a willing, comparable, new, non-expansion, non-renewal, non-equity tenant would pay, and a willing, comparable landlord of a comparable building would accept under the transaction as further defined above.

 

If Landlord and Tenant are not able to agree on the Fair Market Rent for the Extended Term within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s notice of election to renew, then such Fair Market Rent shall be determined as follows. Landlord and Tenant shall each select an appraiser with at least ten years experience in the Seattle commercial market. If the two appraisers are unable to agree within ten (10) days after their selection, they shall select a similarly qualified third appraiser (the “Neutral Appraiser”). Within twenty (20) days after selection of the Neutral Appraiser, the three appraisers shall simultaneously exchange determinations of Fair Market Rent. If the lowest appraisal is not less than ninety percent (90%) if the highest appraisal, then the three appraisals shall be averaged and the result shall be the Fair Market Rent. If the lowest appraisal is less than ninety percent (90%) of the highest appraisal, then the Fair Market Rent shall be deemed the rent set forth in the appraisal submitted an appraiser appointed by a party that is closest in dollar amount to the appraisal submitted by the Neutral Appraiser.

 	4.2	Payment of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Expenses. Taxes and Insurance.

On or before the first day of each month, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a monthly installment equal to one-twelfth of the amount by which Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Costs are so estimated to exceed the Base Year Operating costs. If during any consecutive twelve (12) month period of the Term, Landlord determines that its good faith estimate was incorrect by a material amount. Landlord may provide Tenant with a revised estimate during such twelve (12) month period. After its receipt of the revised estimate, Tenant’s monthly payments of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Costs shall be based upon the revised estimate. If Landlord does not provide Tenant with such estimate by January 1 of a calendar year, Tenant shall continue to pay monthly installments based on the previous year’s estimate until Landlord provides Tenant with the new estimate.

Any overpayment shall be refunded to Tenant within thirty (30) days or credited against the next due future installment(s) of Additional Rent.
 

 	    	Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of calculating the amount payable by Tenant, under this Section 4.2, Expenses (with the exception of Uncontrollable Expenses (defined below)) shall not exceed for any calendar year during the Term of this Lease, other than the first calendar year, the amount of Expenses for the preceding calendar year plus five percent (5%) (compounded annually). Any increases in Expenses not recovered by Landlord due to the foregoing limitation shall be carried forward into all succeeding calendar years during the Term (subject to the foregoing limitation) until fully recouped by Landlord. The term “Uncontrollable Expenses” means expenses relating to the cost of utilities, insurance, and other uncontrollable expenses (such as, but not limited to, increases in the minimum wage which may affect the cost of service contracts).
 

 	    	By May 1 following the end of each calendar year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a statement of the actual amount of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Costs incurred in the preceding calendar year, and the difference (“Actual Owed Amount”) between such actual amount and the Base Year Operating Costs. If the Actual Owed Amount is less than the sum of estimated payments made by Tenant during the preceding calendar year, Landlord shall apply such overpayment by Tenant against Additional Rent due or next becoming due, provided if the Term expires before the determination of the overpayment, Landlord shall refund any overpayment to Tenant after first deducting the amount of Rent due.

Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord and Tenant hereby waive, and shall cause their respective insurance carriers to waive, any and all rights of recovery, claim, action or causes of action against the other and their respective trustees, principals beneficiaries, partners, officers, directors, agents, and employees, for any loss or damage that may occur to Landlord or Tenant or any party claiming by, through or under Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, with respect to Tenant’s Property, the Property, the Premises, any additions or improvements to the Property, or Premises, or any contents thereof, including all rights of recovery, claims, actions or causes of action arising out of the negligence of Landlord or any Landlord Related Parties or the negligence of Tenant or any Tenant Related Parties, which loss or damage is (or would have been, had the insurance required by this Lease been carried) covered by Insurance.

 

17.	Casualty Damage.
 

 	17.1	If all or any part of the Premises are damaged by fire or other casualty, Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord in writing. During any period of time that all or a portion of the Premises is rendered untenantable as a result of a fire or other casualty, the Rent shall abate for the portion of the Premises that is untenantable and not used by Tenant. Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease if: (1) the Property or the Premises shall be damaged so that, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, substantial alteration or reconstruction of the Property not covered by insurance shall be required (whether or not the Premises has been damaged) and Landlord is therefore terminating all leases in the Building; (2) Landlord is not permitted by law to rebuild the Property or the Premises in substantially the same form as existed before the fire or casualty (in which event Tenant may also terminate this Lease): (3) the Premises have been materially damaged and there is less than two(2) years of the Term remaining on the date of the casualty: (4) any Mortgages requires that such insurance proceeds be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt: or (5) a material uninsured loss to the Property or the Premises occurs. Landlord may exercise its right to terminate this Lease by notifying Tenant in writing within ninety (90) days after the date of the casualty. If landlord does not terminate this Lease, Landlord shall commence and proceed with reasonable diligence to repair and restore the Premises and the Leasehold improvements (excluding any Alterations that were performed by Tenant in violation of this Lease). However, in no event shall Landlord be required to spend more than the insurance proceeds received by Landlord. Landlord shall not be liable for any loss or damage to Tenant’s Property or to the business of Tenant resulting in any way from the fire or other casualty or from the repair and restoration of the damage. Landlord and Tenant hereby waive the provisions of any Law relating to the matters addressed in this Article, and agree that their respective rights from damage to or destruction of the Premises shall be those specifically provided in this Lease.
 

 	17.2	If all or any portion of the Premises shall be made untenantable by fire or other casualty, Landlord shall, with reasonable promptness, cause an architect or general contractor selected by Landlord to provide Landlord and Tenant with a written estimate of the amount of time required to substantially complete the repair and restoration of the Premises and make the Premises tenantable again, using standard working methods (“Completion Estimate”). If the Completion Estimate indicates that the Premises cannot be made tenantable within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the repair and restoration is started, then regardless of anything in Section 17.1 above to the contrary, either party shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to the other of such election within ten (10) days after receipt of the Completion Estimate.
 

18. Condemnation. Either party may terminate this Lease if the whole or any material part of the Premises shall be taken or condemned for any public or quasi-public use under Law, by eminent domain or private purchase in lieu thereof (a “Taking”). Landlord shall also have the right to terminate this Lease if there is a Taking of any portion of the Property or the Premises which would leave the remainder of the Property or the Premises unsuitable for use as an office building in a manner comparable to the Property’s or the Premises use prior to the Taking. In order to exercise its right to terminate the Lease, Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, must provide written notice of termination to the other within forty-five (45) days after the Taking. Any such termination shall be effective as of the date the physical taking of the Premises or the portion of the Property or the Premises occurs. If this Lease is not terminated, the Rentable Area of the Property, the Rentable Area of the Premises, Tenants Pro Rate Share shall, if applicable, be appropriately adjusted. In addition, Rent for any portion of the Premises taken or condemned shall be abated during the unexpired Term of this Lease effective when the physical taking of the portion of the Premises occurs. All compensation awarded for a Taking, or sale proceeds, shall be the property of Landlord, any right to receive compensation or proceeds being expressly waived by Tenant. However, Tenant may file a separate claim at its sole cost and expense for Tenant’s Property and Tenant’s reasonable relocation expenses, provided the filing of the claim does not diminish the award which would otherwise be receivable by Landlord.

19. Events of Default. Tenant shall be considered to be in default of this Lease upon the occurrence on any of the following events of default:

 

 	19.1.	Tenant’s failure to pay when due all or any portion of the Rent, if the failure continues for three (3) business days after written notice to Tenant (“Monetary Default”).
 

 	19.2	Tenant’s failure (other than a Monetary Default) to comply with any term, provision or covenant of this Lease, if the failure is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice to Tenant. However, if Tenant’s failure to comply cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days, Tenant shall be allowed additional time as is reasonably necessary to cure the failure so long as; (1) Tenant commences to cure the failure within thirty (30) days, and (2) Tenant diligently pursues a course of action that will cure the failure and bring Tenant back into compliance with the Lease. However, if Tenant’s failure to comply creates a hazardous condition, the failure must be cured immediately upon notice to Tenant.
 

 	19.3	Tenant becomes insolvent, makes a transfer in fraud of creditors or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or admits in writing its inability to pay its debts when due.
 

 	19.4	Tenant’s leasehold estate is taken by process or operation of Law.
 

20.	Remedies.
 

 	20.1	Upon any default, Landlord shall have the right without notice or demand (except as provided in Article 19) to pursue any of its rights and remedies at Law or in equity, including any one or more of the following remedies:
 

 	20.1.1	Terminate this Lease, in which case Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, if Tenant fails to surrender the Premises. Landlord may, in compliance with applicable Law and without prejudice to any other right or remedy, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel and remove Tenant, Tenant’s Property and any party occupying all or any part of the Premises. Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand the amount of all past due Rent and other losses and damages which Landlord may suffer as a result of Tenant’s default, whether by Landlord’s inability to relet the Premises on satisfactory terms or otherwise, including, without limitation, all Costs of Reletting (defined below) and any deficiency that may arise from reletting or the failure to relet the Premises. “Costs of Reletting” shall include all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in reletting or attempting to relet the Premises, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, brokerage commissions, the cost of alterations and the value of other concessions or allowance granted to a new tenant.
 

 	20.1.2	Terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises and, in compliance with applicable Law, expel and remove Tenant, Tenant’s Property and any parties occupying all or any part of the Premises. Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to, except to the extent required by law) relet all or any part of the Premises, without notice to Tenant, for a term that may be greater or less than the balance of the Term and on such conditions (which may include concessions, free rent and alterations of the Premises) and for such uses as Landlord in its absolute discretion shall determine. Landlord may collect and receive all rents and other income from the reletting. Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand all past due Rent, all Costs of Reletting and any deficiency arising from the reletting or failure to relet the Premises. Landlord shall not be responsible or liable for the failure to relet all or any part of the Premises or for the failure to collect any Rent. The re-entry or taking of possession of the Premises shall not be construed as an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of termination is given to Tenant.
 

 	20.1.3	In the event that Landlord shall elect to terminate this Lease under Section 20.1.1, then upon such termination Tenant shall (if it has not already done so) quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord and Landlord may recover from Tenant:
 

(i) The worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; plus

 

(ii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus

 

(iii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; plus

 

CONOCO PHILLIPS, 1144 EASTLAKE LEASE

 	PAGE 12
 	 	SEPTEMBER 12, 2003
(iv) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the damage proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.

 

As used in (i) and (ii) above, the “worth at the time of award” is computed by allowing interest at 12% per annum. As used in (iii) above, the worth at the time of award” is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus 1%.

 

 	20.2	Unless expressly provided in this Lease, the repossession or re-entering of all or any part of the Premises shall not relieve Tenant of its liabilities and obligations under the Lease. No right or remedy of Landlord shall be exclusive of any other right or remedy. Each right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right and remedy now or subsequently available to Landlord at Law or in equity. If Landlord declares Tenant to be in default, Landlord shall be entitled to receive interest on any unpaid item of Rent at a rate equal to 12% per annum. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more remedies shall not constitute a waiver of any default.
 

21. Landlord’s Default; Limitation of Liability. Landlord’s failure to perform or observe any of its obligations under this Lease or to correct a breach of any warranty or representation made in this Lease within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Tenant setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and extent of the failure (or if more than thirty (30) days is required to cure the breach, Landlord’s failure to begin curing within the thirty (30) day period and diligently prosecute the cure to completion) shall constitute a default by Landlord. In no event shall Tenant have the right to terminate this Lease as a result of Landlord’s default and Tenant’s remedies shall be limited to damages and/or an injunction: and in no case may the Tenant withhold any Rent or claim a set-off or deduction from Rent. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS LEASE, THE LIABILITY OF LANDLORD (AND OF ANY SUCCESSOR LANDLORD) TO TENANT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE INTEREST OF LANDLORD IN THE PROPERTY AND ANY PROCEEDS THEREOF. TENANT SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO LANDLORD’S INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY AND ANY PROCEEDS THEREOF FOR THE RECOVERY OF ANY JUDGMENT OR AWARD AGAINST LANDLORD. NEITHER LANDLORD NOR ANY LANDLORD RELATED PARTY SHALL BE PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR ANY JUDGMENT OR DEFICIENCY. BEFORE FILING SUIT FOR AN ALLEGED DEFAULT BY LANDLORD, TENANT SHALL GIVE LANDLORD AND THE MORTGAGEE(S) (DEFINED IN ARTICLE 25 BELOW) WHOM TENANT HAS BEEN NOTIFIED HOLD MORTGAGES (DEFINED IN ARTICLE 25 BELOW) ON THE PROPERTY, BUILDING OR PREMISES, NOTICE AND REASONABLE TIME TO CURE THE ALLEGED DEFAULT. IN ADDITION, TENANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY ENTITY MANAGING THE PREMISES ON BEHALF OF LANDLORD, OR WHICH EXECUTES THIS LEASE AS AGENT FOR LANDLORD, IS ACTING SOLELY IN ITS CAPACITY AS AGENT FOR LANDLORD AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LEASE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY WAIVED BY TENANT, UNLESS DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH ENTITY OR AGENT.

 

22. No Waiver. Either party’s failure to declare a default immediately upon its occurrence, or delay in taking action for a default shall not constitute a waiver of the default, nor shall it constitute an estoppel. Either party’s failure to enforce its rights for a default shall not constitute a waiver of its rights regarding any subsequent default. Receipt by Landlord of Tenant’s keys to the Premises shall not constitute an acceptance or surrender of the Premises.

 

23. Quiet Enjoyment. Tenant shall, and may peacefully have, hold and enjoy the Premises, subject to the terms of this Lease, provided Tenant pays the Rent and fully performs all of its covenants and agreements. This covenant and all other covenants of Landlord shall be binding upon Landlord and its successors only during its or their respective periods of ownership of the Premises, and shall not be a personal covenant of Landlord or the Landlord Related Parties.

 

24. Holding Over. If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, occupancy of the Premises after the termination or expiration shall be that of a tenancy at sufferance. Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises during the holdover shall be subject to all the terms and provisions of this Lease and Tenant shall pay an amount (on a per month basis without reduction for partial months during the holdover) equal to one hundred seventy five percent (175%) of the sum of the Base Rent and Additional Rent due for the period immediately preceding the holdover. No holdover by Tenant or payment by Tenant after the expiration or early termination of this Lease shall be construed to extend the Term or prevent Landlord from immediate recovery of possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or otherwise. In addition to the payment of the amounts provided above, if Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Premises to a new tenant, or to perform improvements for a new tenant, as a result of Tenant’s holdover and Tenant fails to vacate the Premises within fifteen (15) days after Landlord notifies Tenant of Landlord’s inability to deliver possession, or perform improvements. Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for all damages, including, without limitation, consequential damages, that Landlord suffers from the holdover.

 

25.	Subordination to Mortgages; Estoppel Certificate; Mortgagee Protection.
 

 	25.1	Subject to the terms of this Section. Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage(s), deed(s) of trust or other lien(s) now or subsequently arising upon the

Tenant agrees to execute any reasonable documents required to effectuate such subordination. In lieu of having the Mortgage be superior to this Lease, a Mortgagee shall have the right at any time to subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease. If requested by a successor-in-interest to all or a part of Landlord’s interest in the Lease, Tenant shall, without charge, attorn to the successor-in-interest. Landlord and Tenant shall each, within ten (10) business days after receipt of a written request from the other, execute and deliver an estoppel certificate to those parties as are reasonably requested by the other (including a Mortgagee or prospective purchaser). The estoppel certificate shall include a statement certifying that this Lease is unmodified (except as identified in the estoppel certificate) and in full force and affect, describing the dates to which Rent and other charges have been paid, representing that, to such party’s actual knowledge, there is no default for stating the nature of the alleged default) and indicating other matters with respect to the Lease that may reasonably be requested.
 

 	25.2	Tenant agrees to give any mortgagee or deed of trust holder, by certified mail, a copy of any notice of default served upon the Landlord, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified in writing (by way of Notice of Assignment of Rents and Leases, or otherwise) of the addresses of such mortgagee or deed of trust holder. Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within the time provided for in this Lease, then the mortgagees and/or trust deed holders have an additional thirty (30) days within which to cure such default or if such default cannot be cured within that time, then such additional time as may be necessary if within such thirty (30) days any mortgagee or deed of trust holder has commenced and is diligently pursuing the remedies necessary to cure such default (including but not limited to commencement of foreclosure proceedings if necessary to affect such cure), in which event this Lease shall not be terminated if such remedies are being so diligently pursed.
 

26. Attorneys’ Fees. If either party institutes a suit against the other for violation of or to enforce any covenant or condition of this Lease, or if either party intervenes in any suit in which the other is a party to enforce or protect its interest or rights, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all of its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees.

 

27. Notice. If a demand, request, approval, consent or notice (collectively referred to as a “notice”) shall or may be given to either party by the other, the notice shall be in writing and delivered by hand or sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, or sent by overnight or same day courier service at the party’s respective Notice Address (es) set forth in Article 1, except that if Tenant has vacated the Premises (or if the Notice Address for Tenant is other than the Premises, and Tenant has vacated such address) without providing Landlord a new Notice Address, Landlord may serve notice in any manner described in this Article or in any other manner permitted by Law. Each notice shall be deemed to have been received or given on the earlier to occur of actual delivery or the date on which delivery is refused, or, if Tenant has vacated the Premises or the other Notice Address of Tenant without providing a new Notice Address, three (3) days after notice is deposited in the U.S. mail or with a courier service in the manner described above.

 	31.8	Time is of the essence with respect to Tenant’s exercise of any expansion, renewal or extension rights granted to Tenant.
