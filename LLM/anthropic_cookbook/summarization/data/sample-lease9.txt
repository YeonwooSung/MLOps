Subtenant covenants and agrees that (a) during the Term (as hereinafter defined) of this Sublease, Subtenant will perform and observe all of the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements of the Master Lease to be performed by Sublandlord (including, without limitation, the providing of estoppel certificates and subordination agreements in accordance with the Master Lease, if applicable) to the extent that the same are not modified or amended by this Sublease, (b) Subtenant shall not do, suffer or permit anything to be done which would constitute a default under the Master Lease or might cause the Master Lease to be canceled, terminated or forfeited, and (c) Subtenant will, in accordance with Section 9 below, and subject to the limitations therein, indemnify and hold harmless Sublandlord and Master Landlord from and against all claims, liabilities, losses and damages of any kind that Sublandlord or Master Landlord may incur to the extent they are by reason of, resulting from or arising out of a failure by Subtenant to comply with the provisions of this Sublease and/or the Master Lease, including, without limitation, subsections (a) and (b) of this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subtenant shall have no obligation to cure any default of Sublandlord under the Master Lease (except to the extent such default is caused by Subtenant’s default hereunder).

4.2 Utilization of Master Lease Provisions as Part of Sublease.

 

(a) Except as the terms and conditions set forth in this Sublease modify or contradict the terms and conditions of the Master Lease or any exhibits or attachments thereto, all of the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease are hereby made a part of this Sublease and are deemed to constitute a portion of the agreement between Sublandlord and Subtenant concerning the leasing of the Subleased Premises; provided, however, that to the extent any of the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are inappropriate or inapplicable to this Sublease, such terms and provisions shall not be made a part hereof and in the event of any inconsistency between the Master Lease and this Sublease, as between Sublandlord and Subtenant, the provisions of this Sublease shall take precedence over any conflicting provisions of the Master Lease. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that the following provisions of the Master Lease shall not be applicable to this Sublease: Sections 1.2 (except with respect to Master Landlord’s address), 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 7.2.E., 7.2.H., Article 3, Sections 9.2, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 11.2, 12.1, 15.7 (except with respect to providing notice to Master Landlord), 15.11, Paragraphs 1, 2, 12 and 15 of the Lease Rider and Exhibits B and E. Where references are made in the Master Lease to the “Premises”, the same shall be deemed to refer to the Subleased Premises hereunder; where references are made in the Master Lease to the “Commencement Date,” the same shall be deemed to refer to the Commencement Date hereunder; where references are made to the Master Lease to “Base Monthly Rent”, the same shall be deemed to refer to Monthly Base Rent hereunder; where references are made under the Master Lease to “Additional Rent”, the same shall be deemed to refer to Additional Rent hereunder; and where references are made in the Master Lease to “this Lease” the same shall be deemed to refer to this Sublease.

 

(b) It is understood by Subtenant that the services, repairs and alterations referred to herein to be furnished in accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease will in fact be furnished by Master Landlord and not by Sublandlord. Sublandlord shall not be liable to Subtenant nor shall Subtenant’s obligations hereunder be impaired or the performance thereof excused because of any failure or delay on Master Landlord’s part in furnishing any such service or in making any of such repairs or alterations unless and to the extent that Sublandlord reasonably agrees that Sublandlord’s performance of such obligations is excused pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any default by Master Landlord results in a waiver or deferral of the performance of any of Sublandlord’s obligations under the Master Lease, the same obligations of Subtenant hereunder shall be similarly waived or deferred, as applicable, but all other obligations of Subtenant shall remain in full force and effect. Sublandlord agrees that if Master Landlord fails to provide any thing or service which Master Landlord is required to provide pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease, or otherwise defaults thereunder, Sublandlord will, upon the written request of Subtenant and at Subtenant’s cost and expense (except to the extent that such costs and expenses are reimbursed by Master Landlord to Sublandlord), provide such assistance as Subtenant may reasonably request, including without limitation, making a claim and/or demand on Master Landlord in the name of Sublandlord, to effect a cure of such default by Master Landlord or otherwise. Likewise, if Sublandlord defaults under the Master Lease, Subtenant shall have the

right (subject to any applicable notice and cure provisions in the Master Lease and in this Sublease and subject to the consent of Master Landlord being first had and obtained), but not the obligation, to cure any such default, on behalf of Sublandlord and at Sublandlord’s cost and expense, including, without limitation, offsetting any costs and expenses incurred by Subtenant against Monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent payable hereunder (provided that Subtenant may not exercise the foregoing right of offset if Sublandlord has notified Subtenant that Sublandlord is disputing such alleged default in good faith and Master Landlord has not availed itself of any of its remedies under the Master Lease which would impair the continued existence of this Sublease). It is further understood by Subtenant that its rights with respect to the repair and restoration of the Subleased Premises or the Building, its rights as to the use and application of insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds, its rights to rent abatement and its right to terminate this Sublease in the event of damage to or condemnation of all or any part of the Subleased Premises or the Building are all subject to the prior rights, if any, of Master Landlord. All expenses incurred by Master Landlord in connection with the Landlord Consent (as defined herein) shall be paid one-half by each party hereto.

 

(c) It is further understood by Subtenant that Sublandlord will not be obligated to comply with Master Landlord’s responsibilities pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Master Lease relating to “Compliance with Law”, and Section 11.1 relating to “Landlord’s Duty to Restore” and Paragraph 16 of the Lease Rider relating to “Adjacent Property Rights.” In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, only Master Landlord exclusively, not Sublandlord, shall have the rights of “Landlord” pursuant to the following provisions of the Master Lease as incorporated herein: Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2 (provided, however, such alterations and improvements shall not materially impair Sublandlord’s Point of Presence and conduits pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3 hereof, and Subtenant shall provide notice to Sublandlord in each case in which notice is provided to Master Landlord pursuant to Section 5.2 of the Master Lease), 6.3, 7.2(D), 7.2(G), Article 8, 11.2, 11.3, 12.1 and 12.5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Sublease, the parties agree and acknowledge that any right to terminate the leasehold interest by Subtenant shall only be with respect to the Sublease and not the Master Lease, and Sublandlord shall retain the retain the right to terminate the Master Lease pursuant to the terms thereof. Any attempt by Subtenant to terminate the Master Lease shall be null and void.

Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord as “Monthly Base Rent” the following amounts: (i) during the first two (2) years of the Term, an amount equal to [*] payable by Sublandlord under the Master Lease; and (ii) thereafter, for the remainder of the Term, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord, [*] payable by Sublandlord under the Master Lease. Notwithstanding the immediately previous sentence or anything to the contrary contained herein, (x) if a Subtenant Default occurs during the first 2-years of the Term, the Monthly Base Rent payable by Subtenant shall increase to [*]; and (y) if a Subtenant Default occurs after the initial two years of the Term, Subtenant shall, within thirty (30) days of Sublandlord’s written demand, pay to Sublandlord an amount equal to [*] multiplied by the number of days elapsed from the Commencement Date until the date on which Subtenant’s Default occurred, but not to exceed a total of [*], as well as all unpaid and accrued rental amounts. The foregoing sentence shall not limit and the Sublandlord shall have available to it all other non-monetary remedies available to it pursuant to Section 13.2 of the Master Lease. As used herein, “Subtenant Default” shall mean a default by Subtenant hereunder that continues beyond any applicable grace, notice and cure periods. Subtenant agrees to commence paying an amount equal to [*] in advance for the first month of the Term on the Commencement Date and to make rent payments thereafter on the first day of each month during the remaining Term of this Sublease. All rental amounts hereunder for any partial month will be prorated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed. Except as expressly permitted in this Sublease, all rental amounts hereunder shall be payable to Sublandlord without notice, demand, deduction, offset or abatement in lawful money of the United States of America at P.O. Box 219061, Kansas City, MO 64121-9061 or to such other person or at such other address as Sublandlord may designate in writing. If any Monthly Base Rent or Additional Rent is not received by Sublandlord from Subtenant within five (5) days of the later of (i) when due or (ii) after written notice to Subtenant that the same has not been received by Sublandlord (provided such notice for late payment has not previously been given in the preceding twelve months), then Subtenant shall immediately pay to Sublandlord a late charge equal to the lesser of any penalties, default interest charges or other similar costs computed based on the delinquent amount actually incurred by Sublandlord under the Master Lease by reason of Subtenant’s late payment or [*] percent ([*]%) of such delinquent rent, as liquidated damages for Subtenant’s failure to make timely payment. If any rent remains delinquent for a period in excess of thirty (30) days then, in addition to such late charge, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord interest on any rent that is not paid when due at the Agreed Interest Rate following the date such amount became due until paid. This paragraph shall not be deemed to grant Subtenant an extension of time within which to pay rent or prevent Sublandlord from exercising any other right or remedy.

 

7.2 Other Charges. Subtenant shall pay all sales and uses taxes levied or assessed against all rent payments due under this Sublease (if any) simultaneously with each payment required hereunder. Subtenant shall pay directly to Sublandlord all of those costs, expenses, additional rent and all other amounts (defined as “Additional Rent” in the Master Lease) payable to Master Landlord under the Master Lease, including, but not limited to, those

 

*	 	CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED. CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
amounts payable under Sections 3.2 and 8.1 of the Master Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Sublease, Subtenant shall not be responsible for any charges, costs, expenses or similar items (“Charges”) deemed to be Additional Rent if and to the extent said Charges are incurred as a result of Sublandlord in its role as Tenant under Master Lease breaching its representations, warranties and covenants thereunder (including, without limitation, damages claimed by Master Landlord, indemnification obligations owed to Master Landlord, enforcement fees owed to Master Landlord and costs of discharging mechanic’s liens arising through Sublandlord) which have not been assumed by Subtenant hereunder. In addition, Additional Rent shall not include premiums for insurance policies required to be maintained by Sublandlord (in its capacity as tenant under the Master Lease) pursuant to the Master Lease, and Excess rent required to be paid by Sublandlord pursuant to Article 14 of the Master Lease. Subtenant agrees to pay any and all such Additional Rent in estimated equal monthly installments or as may otherwise be required under the terms of the Master Lease. During the Term, Master Landlord may be permitted to adjust the amounts of such installments payable under the Master Lease. In such event, Sublandlord may adjust the amount of the installments due hereunder and, at the end of each calendar year during the Term, an adjustment will be made to compensate for any overage or shortfall with respect to the monthly estimated installments paid versus the actual real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance costs, management fees and the like owed, as and when provided in the Master Lease. To the extent Master Landlord has not agreed to do so pursuant to the Landlord’s Consent, Sublandlord shall promptly forward to Subtenant any statements received from Master Landlord relating to the payment of Common Operating Expenses and annual reconciliations thereof.

 

If Subtenant so requests, Sublandlord shall, at no cost or expense to Sublandlord, exercise the right to contest Real Property Taxes pursuant to Section 8.3 of the Master Lease. If Subtenant so requests, Sublandlord shall cause an audit of Master Landlord’s books and records as permitted and in the manner provided for under Section 8.1 of the Master Lease. Any and all costs incurred by Sublandlord shall be borne by Subtenant and shall be considered Additional Rent. To the extent Master Landlord is not ultimately required to bear the costs of such audit in accordance with the Master Lease, the costs of such audit shall be borne by Subtenant, but in no event shall be Sublandlord be liable for such costs. Regardless of whether Subtenant elects to cause an audit of Master Landlord’s books and records, if Sublandlord’s payments toward Common Operating Expenses exceed the total payments made by Subtenant, Subtenant shall pay Sublandlord the deficiency within thirty (30) days of the date of Sublandlord’s statement. If the total payments by Subtenant, as determined pursuant to the audit, exceed the total actual amount of Additional Rent owed by Subtenant, Subtenant’s excess payment shall be refunded to Subtenant within thirty (30) days of the date of Sublandlord’s statement, and if not refunded within thirty (30) days, may be offset by Subtenant against the next installment of Monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent payable hereunder. For any partial calendar year at the commencement or termination of this Sublease, Subtenant’s Additional Rent for such year shall be prorated for the number of days this Sublease is in effect during such year. Notwithstanding the termination of this Sublease, within thirty (30) business days after Subtenant’s receipt of Sublandlord’s statement regarding Additional Rent in the calendar year in which this Sublease terminates, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord or shall receive from Sublandlord, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between the actual amount of Additional Rent (as prorated) and the amount previously paid by Subtenant toward Additional Rent.

7.3 Survival. Subtenant’s obligation to pay all rental amounts hereunder and to remove alterations and improvements (except as provided in Section 4.2(ii) hereof), as well as any other obligation of Subtenant hereunder which is not fully satisfied at the termination of this Sublease, will survive the termination of this Sublease. Sublandlord’s obligation to refund to Subtenant any overpayments of Additional Rent shall also survive the termination of this Sublease.

 

8. Use. The Subleased Premises may be used and occupied during the Term of this Sublease only for those purposes for which the Premises may be used and occupied by Sublandlord pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease. Subtenant must, at Subtenant’s expense, comply promptly with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, restrictions of record and requirements in effect during the Term or any part of the Term hereof regulating the use by Subtenant of the Subleased Premises.

 

9. Indemnity. Subtenant hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Sublandlord and Master Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or losses incurred by Sublandlord or Master Landlord arising out of any breach by Subtenant of any of the terms of, or its representations contained in, this Sublease, for bodily injury to or death of any person or damage to any property arising out of Subtenant’s use of the Subleased Premises or from the conduct of Subtenant’s business, or from any activity, work or thing done, permitted or suffered by Subtenant in or about the Subleased Premises or the Building, except:

Such profit shall be calculated after deducting from gross rentals all costs incurred by Subtenant in connection with such transaction, including real estate commissions, legal fees, concessions, tenant improvement allowances, advertising costs, and the like. To the extent that Master Landlord successfully asserts a claim to collect any portion of such profits, they shall be paid equally by Subtenant and Sublandlord from their respective shares of such profit.

 

12.5 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sublandlord’s consent shall not be required hereunder for any agreements with Customers for which Master Landlord’s consent is not required pursuant to Section 14.1D of the Master Lease. In addition, Sublandlord shall not be entitled to share in any of Subtenant’s profits, rents or income derived in connection with any Customer’s use of the Subleased Premises.

 

13. Insurance. Subtenant agrees to maintain during the Term hereof at least the minimum insurance described in Section 9.1 of the Master Lease. Sublandlord and Master Landlord must be named as an additional insured on the commercial general liability insurance coverage. A certificate evidencing such insurance coverages shall be delivered to Sublandlord and Master Landlord on or before the first to occur of the Commencement Date or the date when Subtenant shall enter into possession of the Subleased Premises. Each of Sublandlord and Subtenant shall cause its insurance carriers to waive all rights of subrogation against the other party hereto to the extent of Sublandlord’s and Subtenant’s undertakings set forth in Section 10 of this Sublease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Master Lease, Subtenant shall be exclusively entitled to all insurance proceeds arising under any fire and property damage insurance policies maintained by Subtenant on Subtenant’s personal property, equipment and trade fixtures.

 

14. Sublandlord’s Options Pursuant to the Master Lease. Sublandlord and Subtenant agree that all options that Sublandlord has pursuant to the Master Lease, i.e., Sublandlord’s Option to Extend pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Lease Rider to the Master Lease and Sublandlord’s Right of First Offer to Purchase pursuant to Paragraph 15 of the Sublease shall be subordinate to Subtenant’s obligation and option to enter into the New Lease with Master Landlord as provided in the Landlord Consent. Sublandlord also agrees that while this Sublease remains in effect, Sublandlord shall neither have the right to nor exercise any such option without the prior written consent of Subtenant, which consent may be granted or withheld in Subtenant’s sole and absolute discretion.

 

15. Notices. Except as otherwise provided in the Master Lease with respect to notices to Master Landlord or as hereinafter provided as to notices of default by Sublandlord and

Subtenant, any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective only (a) three (3) days after deposit in a sealed envelope in the United States mail, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the recipient at the address set forth below, (b) the next business day following deposit with an overnight courier service, with next day delivery charges prepaid, or (c) upon receipt if delivered by facsimile transmission.

16. Broker’s Commissions. Sublandlord and Subtenant each hereby represents and warrants to the other and to Master Landlord that neither party entered into any agreement with any broker, agent, finder or other party for the payment of a broker’s or agent’s commission, finder’s fee or like compensation payable in connection with Sublandlord and Subtenant entering into this Sublease. Sublandlord and Subtenant each hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the other and Master Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, losses or causes of action related to or arising out of any such agreement entered into by the indemnifying party for the payment of any such commission, fee or like compensation.

18. Personal Property. Sublandlord and Subtenant are simultaneously entering into a certain Bill of Sale and Conveyance Agreement (the “Bill of Sale”), which will become effective on the Closing Date, pursuant to which Sublandlord will transfer to Subtenant certain items of tangible personal property, as provided in the Bill of Sale. Any sales taxes associated with the transfer of such personal property will be paid for as provided in the Bill of Sale.

 

19. Casualty and Eminent Domain. In the event of a fire or other casualty affecting the Subleased Premises, or of a taking of all or a part of the Subleased Premises under the power of eminent domain, Sublandlord shall not exercise any rights which it may have permitting it to terminate or continue with the Master Lease as a result of a casualty or condemnation without first obtaining the prior written consent of Subtenant. If Subtenant fails to respond to such written request by Sublandlord to Subtenant within ten (10) days, then consent will be deemed to have been given. If the Master Lease imposes on Master Landlord, the obligation to repair or restore leasehold improvements or alterations, Subtenant shall permit Master Landlord to enter the Subleased Premises to perform the same. Subtenant shall have the right to terminate the Sublease as a result of a casualty or condemnation to the extent Sublandlord has the right to

terminate the Master Lease as a result of such event. To the extent Sublandlord is entitled to an abatement of its obligation to pay rent pursuant to the Master Lease as a result of the occurrence of a casualty or condemnation, Subtenant shall also be entitled to an abatement of Monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent with respect to the Subleased Premises. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Master Lease is validly terminated by Master Landlord following a casualty or condemnation, this Sublease shall also terminate.

 

20. Entire Agreement. This Sublease, including the terms of the Master Lease which are incorporated herein by reference, contains the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, terms, warranties and representations, whether oral or written, made by the parties concerning the matters covered by this Sublease.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subtenant and Sublandlord shall have the right to disclose such information to their respective lenders or their employees and agents and such other persons whose assistance is required in carrying out the terms of this letter provided that all such persons are told that such information is confidential and agree (in writing for any third party consultants) to keep such information confidential. Subtenant and Sublandlord shall each have the right to publicize the consummation of this Sublease (other than the monetary terms) in whatever manner each deems appropriate; provided, however, that any press release or other public disclosure regarding the transactions contemplated herein, and the wording of same, must be approved in advance by both parties. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound, either party (or its representative, agents or employees) may (i) consult any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction contemplated by this Sublease and (ii) may at any time disclose to any person, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of such transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided relating to such tax treatment or tax structure. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Sublease.
