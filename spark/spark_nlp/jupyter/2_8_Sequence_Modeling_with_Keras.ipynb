    "# Sequence Modeling with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have looked at documents as bags-of-words. This is a common, easily achievable approach for many NLP tasks. However, this approach produces a low-fidelity model of language. The order of words is essential to the encoding and decoding of meaning in language, and to incorporate this, we will need to model sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "When people refer to sequences in a machine learning context, they are generally talking about sequences of data in which data points are not independent of the data points around them. We can still use features derived from the data point, as with general machine learning, but now we can also use the data and labels from the nearby data points. For example, if we are trying to determine if the token \"produce\" is being used as a noun or verb, knowing what words are around it will be very informative. If the token before it is \"might,\" that indicates \"produce\" is a verb. If \"the\" is the preceding token, that indicates it is a noun. These other words give us context.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if \"to\" precedes \"produce\"? That could still indicate either a noun or a verb. We need to look back further.  This gives us the concept of windows—the amount of context we want to capture. Many algorithms have a fixed amount of context that is decided as a hyperparameter. There are some algorithms, for example LSTMs, that can learn how long to remember the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence problems come from different domains, and in different data formats. In this book we are working with text data, which is a sequence of characters, or words, or even messages. Working with voice data is inherently a sequence problem. Economics, physics, and medicine also have many sequence problems. The statistics and behavior of this data is generally very different among these disparate fields, but there are many techniques in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common techniques used for sequence modeling is a family of machine learning algorithms called graphical models. Graphical models can be used to model probabilistic structures. This is what allows us to capture context. When building the graphical models, we have to decide how much context to capture. How much context we want to capture is based on the specifics of the problem. There are also models that let us learn how much context to use. The algorithm needed to learn a graphical model differs depending on the model chosen. Some can be learned with gradient descent; others have their own learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will go over some of the popular algorithms for learning sequences, such as hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, and recurrent neural networks. Let's start out with sentence segmentation and hidden Markov models."

    "## Sentence Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the   first sequence-modeling problems most learn is the sentence-boundary detection, or SBD problem, in which we want to determine where a sentence boundary is. This seems like a problem that could be solved by a regular expression. We can simply say that every \".\", \"?\", and \"!\" are sentence boundaries. We can add something to check for acronyms—perhaps we can check if the previous character is capitalized and the character after the next whitespace is not. This will still miss some situations with acronyms—for example, two acronyms following each other like \"U.S. D.O.S.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What if our text is not so regularly formatted? If our text has many lists, as is common in technical communications, there may not be sentence-ending punctuation at the end of each item. However, we don't want to call all the items in a list the same sentence. We could make more and more complicated regular expressions, or we could build a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some pros and cons to help us in deciding when to use a regular expression for SBD and when to use a model. Using a regular expression is easy to do, if you ignore some exceptions. If you are in a situation where using a model on text will be difficult, it is best to just use a regular expression. On the other hand, SBD models are somewhat generalizable. That being said, if you use an SBD model built on newspapers to process clinical text, it will produce more errors than you would expect."

    "## (Hidden) Markov Models\n",
    "  Hidden Markov model, or HMM is a popular model for dealing with sequence data. To understand it, we need to discuss Markov models and the Markov property.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Markov property relates to a stochastic (random) process. In a stochastic process, a random variable for time $t$, $X_t$, can be dependent on all previous variables in the sequence, $X_{t-1},X_{t-2},...,X_0$. If $X_t$ is only dependent on the previous variable, $X_{t-1}$, then we say it has the Markov property. This simplifies problems greatly. This is an unrealistic assumption in language. However, like we saw in the previous chapter with independence assumptions of naïve Bayes and logistic regression, unrealistic assumptions don't necessarily produce a bad model. We can also ease the Markov property and say that  is dependent on the last $X_t$ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the relationship between the sequence we wish to model and an observable sequence. Now we can estimate the probability of a particular state as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P[y_{i} = k | x_{i} = c] \\approx P[y_{i} = k | y_{i-1} = k'] \\cdot P[y_{i-1} = k'] \\cdot P[x_{i} = c | y_{i} = k]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the transition probability $P[y_{i} = k | y_{i-1} = k']$, the initial probability $P[y_0 = k]$, and the emission probability $P[x_{i} = c | y_{i} = k]$ directly from the data if we have labels. Once we have this, how do we predict the hidden states, $y_i$? We use the Viterbi algorithm.\n",

Underflow is a limitation of floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers can represent only so much precision. So, if a number approaches too close to 0, the floating-point representation may round to 0. For example, when implementing naïve Bayes, instead of multiplying probabilities, we will add log-probabilities. This is to avoid underflow when multiplying many numbers that are less than 1.\n",

Legal text is broken into different sections, each with different kinds of content and functions. Narrative text is often broken into chapters or scenes.

For example, we may not want to use the same models on an admission note as we do on a radiological exam, even if they are part of the same visit.\n",

Fortunately, regular expressions are even more effective on this problem than sentence-boundary detection."

    "If hidden Markov models are sequential naïve Bayes, then conditional random fields (CRFs) can be thought of as sequential logistic regression. CRFs are another popular technique for part-of-speech tagging. CRFs have a few benefits over HMMs. They allow for more complex features because they make fewer assumptions on the relationships between features and labels. In Spark NLP, CRFs are one approach used for part-of-speech tagging, in addition to using RNNs. CRFs are learned using gradient descent like logistic regression, but they are run using algorithms like the Viterbi algorithm.  "

    "## Chunking and Syntactic Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the parts of speech for individual tokens, we must consider combining them. Many NLP tasks involve finding entities in the text. Often, these entities are referenced using more than one-word phrases. This means that we have to understand how to combine tagged tokens in phrases, which are generally known as chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to sentence-boundary detection, we can do this with a heuristic, but there will be errors that we'll need a model to avoid. The heuristics are relatively simple—if two adjacent tokens have the same or similar tags, combine them into a single phrase. For example, the words \"fan blade\" are both nouns, so they can be combined into a single noun phrase. We can combine certain known structures, like some verb-preposition combinations, such as \"knock off,\" into a single verb or noun. Heuristics won't cover more complex syntactic structures. For example, the verb \"knock off\" inserts its object between \"knock\" and \"off,\" so if you are trying to normalize your vocabulary, the infinitive \"to knock off\" won't be combined with the inflected form \"knocked X off.\" There may also be certain syntactic structures you are interested in, like knowing who did what to whom.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract these more complex syntactic structures, we need a syntactic parser. These models turn sequences into tree structures. The tokens then become constituents in larger phrases. Language is very complicated, but fortunately, straightforward structures are generally more common than complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using a syntactic parser, make sure that you are certain that you need it. They are often generally complex models that are resource-intensive to train and use. It's probably best if you try to solve your problem with heuristics first, and if that is not sufficient, consider a syntactic parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional caveat about syntactic parsers is that labeling is a difficult task. Anyone who is fluent in a language can reliably split text into sentences. Most people can learn parts of speech well enough to label data in a few minutes. Syntactic parsing is a significantly more complex labeling task."

    "## Language Models\n",
    "   Another classic application of sequence modeling is language modeling. A language model is a model of process that generates language. This is called a generative model, as opposed to a discriminative model, which is used for distinguishing the difference between things. Of course, the actual process by which human language is generated is incredibly complex, and is still being explored by neurologists, psychologists, and philosophers. In NLP, language models make simplifying assumptions—for example, that the text generation process can be learned from text alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many uses for language models. We can use them for feature generation with other models. For example, a neural-network–based language model can be used to feed into other layers used for sequence labeling. Language models are also used for text generation and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the techniques covered in this chapter can be used to create a language model. For example, we could use a CRF to predict a sequence of words.  We could also use a Markov model to predict a sequence of words by learning the transition probabilities. This would not be a hidden Markov model, because there are no hidden states here. We would likely need a larger context window than just the previous token. Fortunately, we can relax the assumption that the language generation has the Markov property. Once we start doing this, however, our model quickly becomes much more complex. This is related to the complication of syntax that made syntactic parsers so challenging.\n",

    "Here, we specify the maximum context as 10. We could potentially not do so, but that could lead to some technical difficulties. The implementation of sequence modeling expects to know the maximum length of the sequences. Without fixing the size of the window, the length of the longest word will determine this length. Because long words are much more rare than short ones, most of our sequences will need to be padded. This padding does not help us learn the likely sequences. So there is a trade-off: the larger the window the more context your model has to predict the next item in the sequence. On the other hand, it also increases computational complexity. It's best to realistically consider how large the context is in your data. In English, the median length of vocabulary words is 6 letters. If you take into account word frequency, the median is 4. Indeed, 10 is the 95th percentile of word length considering word frequency. This means that very rarely will information from more than 10 characters away help in predicting the next character."
