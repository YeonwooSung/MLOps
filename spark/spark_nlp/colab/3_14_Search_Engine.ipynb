        "### Model-Centric Metrics\n",
        " When measuring an index, there are many possible metrics. Primarily, we want the best ranking. One way to measure ranking is through recall and precision, which is similar to binary classification problems. The problem is that if we return a hundred documents, recall and precision will not tell us about the order they are in. For that, we need ranking metrics.    One of the most popular kinds of metrics is Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To explain this, we need to build to it.  First, let's define gain. In this context, the gain is the information in the text. We use the relevancy of the document as gain. Cumulative gain is the sum of the gain up to a chosen cutoff. Up until this point there is nothing about rank, so we discount the gain the more we descend the list. We will need to reduce the gain using the rank. We use the logarithm of the rank so that the discount more strongly separates the items early in the list than those later in the list. The last part is the normalization. It is much easier to report a metric if it is between 0 and 1. So we need to determine the ideal discounted cumulative gain. If you cannot calculate it directly, you can estimate it assuming that all documents above the cutoff are relevant. Now let's look at the actual metric.\n",
