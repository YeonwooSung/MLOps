The API is oriented at the API of the [ðŸ¤—  Accelerated Inference API](https://api-inference.huggingface.co/docs/python/html/detailed_parameters.html), meaning your inputs need to be defined in the `inputs` key and if you want additional supported `pipelines` parameters you can add them in the `parameters` key.
