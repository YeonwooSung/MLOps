    "Welcome to this getting started guide. We will use the Hugging Face Inference DLCs and Amazon SageMaker Python SDK to run an [Asynchronous Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/async-inference.html) job.\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference is a new capability in SageMaker that queues incoming requests and processes them asynchronously. Compared to [Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html) [Asynchronous Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/async-inference.html) provides immediate access to the results of the inference job rather than waiting for the job to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works \n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous inference endpoints have many similarities (and some key differences) compared to real-time endpoints. The process to create asynchronous endpoints is similar to real-time endpoints. You need to create: a model, an endpoint configuration, and an endpoint. However, there are specific configuration parameters specific to asynchronous inference endpoints, which we will explore below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Invocation of asynchronous endpoints differs from real-time endpoints. Rather than pass the request payload in line with the request, you upload the payload to Amazon S3 and pass an Amazon S3 URI as a part of the request. Upon receiving the request, SageMaker provides you with a token with the output location where the result will be placed once processed. Internally, SageMaker maintains a queue with these requests and processes them. During endpoint creation, you can optionally specify an Amazon SNS topic to receive success or error notifications. Once you receive the notification that your inference request has been successfully processed, you can access the result in the output Amazon S3 location.\n",
