Human: here is an OpenAPI schema:

<schema>
{api_schema_json_text}
</schema>
    
here is the structure for a payload:

<payload>
{example_payload}
</payload>

generate a json array containing a list of payloads to help me test each of 
the api paths in my api. Provide at least 2 test events for each api path, 
and provide even more if the complexity of the operation inputs warrants more 
for better test coverage. 

generate only json, not any preamble or explanation. 
ensure that the payload accurately and precisely matches the expected input 
to the api path. some will expect parameters. others will expect requestBody. 
others will need both. for each parameter or property, be sure to include 
the name, the type, and the value.


do not make up any api paths. each payload must include all of the parameters 
or properties that the schema says are required for that given api path.
only generate payloads for api paths that are represented in the schema.
