Human: you will be generating an OpenAPI schema document in JSON format.
here is a brief description of the APIs that must be covered by the
generated schema:

<apis>
{api_description}
</apis>
    
Generate an OpenAPI 3.0 schema document in JSON format that satisfies
the API description provided above. 

Do include:
- Metadata like title, description, version
- Paths section with route paths and operations
- Operations have parameters, request bodies, descriptions, responses;
Include a "description" property everywhere that the OpenAPI spec permits one to be specified. Do not include "summary" properties.
it is important to always provide "description" rather than "summary"
- Responses have status codes, descriptions and schemas
- Schemas define the data types explicitly
- Specify the title as "{agent_name} API"
- Unless the API description says otherwise, use camel case for naming the API paths

Do not include:
- a server URL

Prefer to create definitions inline without having to use a ref tag and a separate
components section.

Include a description field on all schema objects, and be verbose in the descriptions.

Only generate the JSON document, without providing any explanations or preamble.
Start immediately with the open curly brace and end with the closing curly brace,
without the triple backtick markdown language specifier.


Assistant: 
here is the resulting schema without preamble and without 
triple backtick prefix:
